 meritocracy_events.2.d: "The national examination system allows us to ensure that all officials have been properly taught about how to best administrate $COUNTRY$ and that only those that are the most suited for this task actually get to do so. At some times the system works better than at others however. According to the Grand Secretary we have had an excellent year, with few incidents of misrule anywhere in the country and a good crop of new examinees entering service."
 meritocracy_events.4.d: "The Examination System has severed the $MONARCHTITLE$s of $COUNTRY$ well for centuries, as in theory it allows us to ensure that only those of the best ability will be selected to act as the officials of the $MONARCHTITLE$. Lately, however, it is widely accepted that the general level of the essays of the examinees has been decreasing. Even the work of this year's optimus is much worse than the failures of some years according to the master examiners."
 flavor_daimyo.17.t: "The Rise of the Yamana"
 flavor_daimyo.17.d: "The assassination of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori by the Akamatsu proved to be extremely profitable to the fortunes of the Yamana clan, not because we had taken issue with the Shogunate itself, but because we seized all the lands and belongings of the Akamatsu in the immediate aftermath. The Shogun has rewarded our loyalty by affirming the right of the Yamana to these newly captured lands, practically forgiving us for the Yamana-led rebellion against the Shogun in 1391.\n\nNonetheless, some clans continue to hold our rise to power in envy and suspicion. In particular, the Hosokawa clan, long one of the most powerful clans in Central Japan, has come to view our growing influence as especially troubling, and may act provocatively in order to place limits upon our ambitions in the near future."
 flavor_daimyo.17.a: "We will bide our time and slowly build our power to challenege the Hosokawa."
 flavor_daimyo.17.b: "Let us forge alliances and pacts to contain Hosokawa influence."

 flavor_boh.1.d: "The Hussite wars technically ended in 1434, but the country was still divided, between those faithful to Rome, and those still loyal to the Hussite ideals. The leader of the Hussite party was Jirí z Podebrad, and after various attempts of reconciliation, he decided upon a military solution. He raised an armed force in northeastern Bohemia and seized Prague with little resistance. Civil War broke out though, as those faithful to Rome fought him, but eventually the Hussites won.\nHowever, Oldrich II z Rozmberka, a staunchly pro-Catholic noble, is also a viable alternative for the rulership of Bohemia. He has stated that he supports the claim of Ladislaus Postumus von Habsburg, the young, titular Duke of Austria and King of Hungary, to the Bohemian throne. Only under Rozmberka leadership can conflict with Rome be avoided. What shall we do?"
