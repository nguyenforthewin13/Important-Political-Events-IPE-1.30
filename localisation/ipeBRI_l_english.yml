 ipeBRI.1.t: "The Duchy of Brittany"
 ipeBRI.1.d: "For years, the Duchy of Brittany has existed as a semi-independent feudal entity on the northwestern edge of France. Fought over by local monarchs, the Angevins, and the Capetians throughout history, the Duchy of Brittany has long been the site of warfare between foreign powers, even during the Hundred Years' War. Now though, the succession to the Duchy is in question, which puts it in danger of being directly inherited by the Kingdom of France, which has always claimed suzerainty over the Duchy.\n\nIf we do not act to secure an heir and allies for the Duchy of Brittany, the French could eventually come to overwhelm and dominate us."
 ipeBRI.1.a: "An English heir would be most suitable."
 ipeBRI.1.a.tooltip: "§RWe will seek a royal marriage and alliance with England. When the ruler of Brittany dies after making this alliance, we will fall into a personal union with England.§!"
 ipeBRI.1.b: "The future of the Duchy is already secure."
 ipeBRI.2.t: "The Duchy of Brittany Seeks Our Aid"
 ipeBRI.2.d: "For years, the Duchy of Brittany has existed as a semi-independent feudal entity on the northwestern edge of France, being fought over by local monarchs, the Angevins, and the Capetians throughout history. Now though, the succession to the Duchy is in question, putting it in jeopardy of being directly inherited by the King of France.\n\nDiplomats from Brittany have suggested to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ that growing French royal power could be stemmed if a marriage alliance were formed between $COUNTRY$ and Brittany. Nonetheless, this would undoubtedly enrage the French."
 ipeBRI.2.a: "We must protect this newfound friend!"
 ipeBRI.2.b: "We should not interfere in the affairs of Brittany."
 ipeBRI.3.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defends Brittany"
 ipeBRI.3.d: "To the great excitement of our diplomats, the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to enter a marriage alliance with the Duchy of Brittany, promising to protect it from all foreign threats, including the incursions of the French. While a pact of blood will keep relations cordial between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and Brittany, it remains to be seen how the French monarchy will respond to this infrigement on its sphere of influence."
 ipeBRI.3.a: "We will stand strong against our common foe."
 ipeBRI.4.t: "England Allies Brittany!"
 ipeBRI.4.d: "Threatened by the growing power of the French monarchy, the nobles of Brittany have sought out a strategic marriage alliance with England, proclaiming their de facto independence from France. According to the terms of this marital alliance, should the ruler of Brittany die, the Duchy will fall into personal union with England. While we have a duty to preserve the territorial integrity of France, our subjects will be undoubtedly enraged if we move to take control of the Duchy of Brittany."
 ipeBRI.4.a: "We cannot afford to be encircled by our enemies."
 ipeBRI.4.a.tooltip: "§RIf it is not subjugated again before the death of its current ruler, Brittany will fall into personal union with England.§!"
 ipeBRI.4.b: "The Duchy of Brittany is of no concern to us."
 ipeBRI.5.t: "The English Rejection"
 ipeBRI.5.d: "To the great disappointment of our diplomats, the ruler of England has refused to enter into a marriage alliance with the Duchy of Brittany, being unwilling to come to blows with the ascendant monarchy of France. Nonetheless, there remain other candidates for alliances against the French, as we can send our diplomats to Castile, where the nobles have likewise become increasingly wary of growing French influence."
 ipeBRI.5.a: "A Castilian heir would defend the interests of Brittany."
 ipeBRI.5.a.tooltip: "§RWe will seek a royal marriage and alliance with Castile. When the ruler of Brittany dies after making this alliance, we will fall into a personal union with Castile.§!"
 ipeBRI.7.t: "The Castilian Rejection"
 ipeBRI.7.d: "To the great disappointment of our diplomats, the ruler of Castile has refused to enter into a marriage alliance with the Duchy of Brittany, being unwilling to come to blows with the ascendant monarchy of France. Nonetheless, there remains one last candidate for alliances against the French, as we can send our diplomats to Austria, where the nobles have become ever more fearful of growing French influence. The Austrians will perhaps commit to do what the English and Castilians would not."
 ipeBRI.7.a: "We need an Austrian heir above all else."
 ipeBRI.7.a.tooltip: "§RWe will seek a royal marriage and alliance with Austria. When the ruler of Brittany dies after making this alliance, we will fall into a personal union with Austria.§!"
 ipeBRI.9.t: "The Austrian Rejection"
 ipeBRI.9.d: "To the great disappointment of our diplomats, the ruler of Austria has refused to enter into a marriage alliance with the Duchy of Brittany, being unwilling to come to blows with the ascendant monarchy of France. All our attempts at securing foreign alliances to defend the Duchy of Brittany have failed, leaving the future of the Duchy uncertain."
 ipeBRI.9.a: "Sad day."
 ipeBRI.10.t: "The Inheritance of Brittany"
 ipeBRI.10.d: "Some time ago, we made a strategic marriage alliance with the Duchy of Brittany. Since then however, the monarch of Brittany has died, leaving no eligible heirs. As a result, we are now the leading claimants to the Breton throne, and control of the Duchy has fallen to us."
 ipeBRI.10.a: "Wonderful!"
 ipeBRI.11.d: "Some time ago, we made a strategic marriage alliance with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Since then though, our monarch has died, leaving no eligible heirs. As a result, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has gained a personal union over Brittany, promising to defend the country from all foreign threats."
 ipeBRI.11.a: "It is better than rule by the French."
 ipeBRI.12.t: "Treason Against France!"
 ipeBRI.12.d: "As expected, our attempt to rein in the rebellious Duchy of Brittany has greatly enraged our other feudal subjects, which now chafe at the expansion of royal power. If we do not act appropriately, a Second League of the Public Weal could form against us and once again cause turmoil within France."
 ipeBRI.12.a: "Deeply unnerving."
 ipeBRI.13.t: "French Aggression in Brittany"
 ipeBRI.13.d: "The French monarchy is now at war to rein in the rebellious Duchy of Brittany, which sought aid from foreign powers to secure its independence from the rulers of France. Nonetheless, the other feudal subjects of France have become once more enraged by this flagrant abuse of royal power, and threaten to make war on the monarchy yet again, proclaiming their support for a Second League of the Public Weal. In these troubling times, how should we respond?"
 ipeBRI.13.a: "Support the League of the Public Weal."
 ipeBRI.13.b: "We will not support rebels."
 ipeBRI.14.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the League of the Public Weal!"
 ipeBRI.14.d: "Our subjects in $FROMCOUNTRY$ have found it fit to oppose us by supporting the Second League of the Public Weal, in response to our quashing of the rebellion in the Duchy of Brittany. Rebels supported by the nobles of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are now pillaging and laying waste to the countryside. If they are not stopped, France will be left in ruin."
 ipeBRI.14.a: "Damnation!"
 ipeBRI.15.t: "The End of the Second League of the Public Weal"
 ipeBRI.15.d: "The conflict with the Duchy of Brittany was increasingly characterized by the relentless interventions of the lesser nobles of France, who sought to further impede growing royal power. Now that the war with Brittany has ended though, the Second League of the Public Weal has disbanded, and the feudal lords begrudgingly accept the supremacy of the monarchy once again. Peace and order will return to the lands of France."
 ipeBRI.15.a: "France will again be as one."
 ipeBRI.16.t: "The $DYNASTY$ Claim to the Duchy of Brittany"
 ipeBRI.16.d: "For years, the Duchy of Brittany has existed as a semi-independent feudal entity on the northwestern edge of France. Fought over by local monarchs, the Angevins, and the Capetians throughout history, the Duchy of Brittany has long been the site of warfare between foreign powers, even during the Hundred Years' War. Now though, the succession to the Duchy is in question, which puts it in danger of being directly inherited by the Kingdom of France, which has always claimed suzerainty over the Duchy.\n\nDiplomats from the Duchy of Brittany have negotiated strategic marriage alliances in order to protect the country from invasion, but we can nonetheless join the lengthening list of potential claimants to the Breton throne, and expand the domains of $COUNTRY$."
 ipeBRI.16.a: "Brittany will be ours!"
 ipeBRI.17.t: "Castile Allies Brittany!"
 ipeBRI.17.d: "Threatened by the growing power of the French monarchy, the nobles of Brittany have sought out a strategic marriage alliance with Castile, proclaiming their de facto independence from France.
