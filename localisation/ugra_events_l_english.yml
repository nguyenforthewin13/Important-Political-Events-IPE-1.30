 ugra.1.t: "The Mongol Yoke"
 ugra.1.d: "In 1237, the ferocious Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' commenced with the Battle of the Kalka River. The mighty Batu Khan, grandson of Temüjin and founder of the Golden Horde, led a sweeping campaign of pillage and destruction through the Rus' lands, destroying many great cities and the neighboring civilizations of Cumania and Volga Bulgaria. By 1242, all the Rus' lands owed allegiance to the Great Khan.\n\nIn the last century though, our hold over the principalities Rus' has weakened. The power of $COUNTRY$ has declined, and with it the ability to keep the northern princes in check. Muscovy has become the greatest of the domains to emerge from the Rus' lands, and their preeminence has become a threat to the continuation of our way of life. For the sake of our own security, the Muscovite threat must be dealt with."
 ugra.1.a: "Demand that the Muscovites pay tribute!"
 ugra.1.a.tooltip: "The Muscovites may refuse our demands."
 ugra.1.b: "Let us keep to the steppes."
 ugra.2.t: "The Mongol Yoke"
 ugra.2.d: "In 1237, the ferocious Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' commenced with the Battle of the Kalka River. The mighty Batu Khan, grandson of Temüjin and founder of the Golden Horde, led a sweeping campaign of pillage and destruction through the Rus' lands, destroying many great cities and the neighboring civilizations of Cumania and Volga Bulgaria. By 1242, all the Rus' lands owed allegiance to the Great Khan.\n\nIn the last century though, $COUNTRY$ has become a rich and prosperous land, preeminent among the states of Rus'. The growth of our power has apparently become a threat to the khans of the $FROMCOUNTRY$, who now look upon us with fear and apprehension. As a result, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ now demands that we pay it tribute, or otherwise its warriors will once again fall upon our cities, like those who came before them. The armies of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ are now amassed on the banks of the Ugra River, scarcely more than a stone's throw away from our own."
 ugra.2.a: "Let us continue paying tribute for now."
 ugra.2.a.tooltip: "As long as Muscovy continues to pay tribute to foreign powers, it will not be possible to unite the Rus' lands into a new nation."
 ugra.2.b: "We fear no khan."
 ugra.2.b.tooltip: "We may be forced to go to war."
 ugra.3.t: "The End of the Mongol Yoke"
 ugra.3.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ has chosen to step away from its claim of mastery over the lands of Rus'. Allegedy, they now claim to hold no interest in our ostensibly pitiful cities, rejecting our sedentary and civilized way of life. Thus the ambassadors of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ have stated that they will keep to the steppes."
 ugra.3.a: "And there they will stay."
 ugra.4.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Submits!"
 ugra.4.d: "The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to submit to the demands of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, acknowledging our primacy over the lands of Rus'. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent us tribute in order to appease our belligerent forces."
 ugra.4.a: "A wise choice."
 ugra.5.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Rejects the Yoke!"
 ugra.5.d: "The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to submit to the demands of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$! The people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are apparently incensed at our attempt to reassert our primacy over Rus', and there is talk of war. How should we respond to $FROMCOUNTRY$?"
 ugra.5.a: "We are sons of Temüjin! To war!"
 ugra.5.b: "Let us keep to the steppes."
 ugra.6.t: "The $FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares War!"
 ugra.6.d: "Angered by our refusal to submit to the Mongol Yoke, the $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared war! They say that they will raze our cities to the ground and destroy all that is left of Rus'. The $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made good on its promise to respond with force."

 ugra.7.d: "Now that we are at war with the Horde, we are officially no longer under the Mongol Yoke. $COUNTRY$ is a free nation."

 ugra.8.t: "The End of the Mongol Yoke"
 ugra.8.d: "Now that we are at war with Muscovy, their rulers no longer have any reason to respect our supremacy. The Mongol Yoke has ended."

 ugra.9.t: "Russian Colonization of the Steppe"
 ugra.9.d: "After our conquest of the hordes which used to rule the steppes, Russian settlers are moving en masse into the new territories, building towns and cities with state military support, extending our rule deep into these unheralded regions. Russians are becoming the new dominant ethnic group in these areas."
 ugra.9.a: "Excellent."
 ugra.11.t: "The Inheritance of Ryazan"
 ugra.11.d: "For years, the Principality of Ryazan has existed on the borders of Rus', on the frontier of the dangerous wilderness controlled by the Great Horde. Although they have long been in the shadow of $COUNTRY$, now the Ryazanian nobles have expressed their displeasure with the current Prince of Ryazan. The Prince, fearing revolt from his subjects, has fled abroad and left the country in the hands of these nobles, who are now calling for Ryazan's integration into $COUNTRY$."
 ugra.11.a: "The lands of Ryazan will make an excellent addition to our own."
 ugra.12.t: "The Khanate of Astrakhan"
 ugra.12.d: "For centuries, the port of Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga on the Caspian has been controlled by the Golden Horde. It has become the greatest slave trading site on the Volga, a bustling hub of commerce between Muscovy, Kazan, Crimea, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. However, the Golden Horde has gradually grown weak, as it has faced breakaway successors in Kazan and Crimea, while being forced to contend with the rising strength of Muscovy. As a result, the city of Astrakhan now clamors for independence, threatening to break away from the Great Horde entirely. Losing Astrakhan would be a devastating blow to our economy, but we may not be able to prevent it."
 ugra.12.a: "Astrakhan is no concern of ours."
 ugra.12.b: "There can only be one khan!"
 ugra.13.t: "The Slaves of the Steppes"
 ugra.13.d: "The abduction of slaves throughout raids on Christian settlements in Eastern Europe has always been a critical element of the economy of the steppe hordes. However, we have now captured some of the provinces which used to serve as the hordes' major slave markets. In the best interests of our Christian brethern, it is time that we end the slave trade in these places once and for all."
 ugra.13.a: "No Christian will be a slave."

 ugra.14.t: "Constantinople Falls"
 ugra.14.d: "For centuries since their conversion by Byzantine missionaries, the people of Rus' have followed the Orthodox faith and adhered to the religious stipulations of Constantinople, the Second Rome. However, the great city on the Bosporus has now fallen to prey to the expansionist whims of the Ottoman Empire, which casts an increasingly dark shadow over the nations of the Balkans. In these troubling times, the Orthodox world looks for leadership as their holy sites and places are overrun by the Muslims, and the Catholics deny aid. $COUNTRY$ is a mighty Orthodox state, supreme in Eastern Europe, and undoubtedly many of our religious compatriots look toward us. Should we declare $CAPITAL_CITY$ as the Third Rome, and the lead the resistance against the Turks?"
 ugra.14.a: "We rule the Third Rome."
 ugra.14.b: "Let's not get ahead of ourselves here."
 ugra.15.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Proclaims the Third Rome!"
 ugra.15.d: "Troubled and anguished by our conquest of the Orthodox holy city of Constantinople, the monarch of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has declared the Third Rome to the north, promising to continue leading Orthodox resistance against the Ottoman Empire. What such a minor state in frigid wastelands could do to our mighty empire is unknown to us, but we should nevertheless keep in mind that we have earned ourselves a new enemy to the north."
 ugra.15.a: "We laugh at their pretensions."
 house_of_rurik: "The House of Rurik"
 desc_house_of_rurik: "Since the earliest days of Kievan Rus', the princes of the House of Rurik have governed in these lands. The Muscovite rulers now are preeminent as the most powerful monarchs of the Rurikid dynasty, and hold the strongest claim to the title of Grand Prince of Rus'. As long as Muscovy is ruled by the Rurikid dynasty, all other princes will turn to us."
 ugra.16.t: "The Fading of Rurikid Influence"
 ugra.16.d: "As a result of a recent change in the political situation of Muscovy, the legitimacy and reputation of the Rurikid dynasty no longer makes a great impact on our subjects. They no longer will be loyal to us simply because our monarchs belong to the House of Rurik."
 ugra.16.a: "We are still true rulers of Rus'."
