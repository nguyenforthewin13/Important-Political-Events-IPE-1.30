 desc_waging_hyw: "Since we are waging the Hundred Years' War against the foreign English threat, our fiefs are more loyal to us than they would otherwise usually be. However, English claims to the French throne and a century of warfare leave the nation extremely unstable, and its government strained. We must end the Hundred Years' War with swiftness."
 ipeFRA.1.t: "The Inheritance of $COUNTRY$"
 ipeFRA.1.d: "For hundreds of years, France was a decentralized state, similar to the Holy Roman Empire in that the King of France struggled to maintain control over the rest of the country while attempting to exert influence from a limited royal domain. Over time, many ostensibly French lands, including the Duchy of Brittany and the Duchy of Burgundy, began to increasingly assert their own independence and undermine the power of the Capetian French kings. Nonetheless, with the extinction of the royal family which governed $COUNTRY$, its lands have been inherited by the King of France, reducing the number of petty nobles who might pose a threat to the internal stability of the kingdom. France is now one step closer to truly becoming a truly united nation."

 ipeFRA.2.a: "Glory to the Kingdom of France!"
 ipeFRA.3.t: "The Edict of Moulins"
 ipeFRA.3.d: "Since the Middle Ages, France has divided its territory among its nobles, granting various titles, offices, estates or other things of value to its nobility, who often developed powerful family dynasties whose influence began to rival that of the King of France.\n\nMany problems arose from this system, with provinces becoming highly autonomous or de facto independent, to the point that some nobles became very powerful on their own and even waged war against the King, sometimes openly allying France's enemies. The Duchy of Burgundy was one such domain which grew incredibly powerful, drifting away from the royal sphere of influence. Many French kings, like Charles V, tried to overcome the feudal system and hold a tighter grip in their domains, but only did so in vain, facing intense resistance from rebellious subjects.\n\nHowever, in 1566, an important royal ordinance was issued under Charles IX, becoming known as the Edict of Moulins. This ordinance dealt with many aspects of the administration of justice, feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, abrogation of the levy of rights of tallage claimed by seigneurs over their dependents, and provisions for a system of concessions on rivers. This Edict also declared that the royal domain could not be alienated except in a few exceptional cases, such as the creation of an appanage, which would return to the crown in its original state upon the extinction of the male line. Therefore, the appanagist could not separate himself from his appanage in any way.\n\nWhile the medieval feudal system was not completely removed until the French Revolution in the late 18th century, the Edict of Moulins greatly increased the influence French monarchs had in their domains and reduced the lesser princes' power considerably."

 ipeFRA.4.d: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ has long been a fief of $COUNTRY$, but now the upstart nobles of $FROMCOUNTRY$, having grown in strength, have finally decided to declare that they are entirely independent of our control. Perhaps the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ wishes to form a new kingdom to rival ours, but we will not yield before these aspirations so easily."
 ipeFRA.4.a: "$COUNTRY$ will be united!"
 ipeFRA.5.t: "The Traitorous Armagnacs"
 ipeFRA.5.d: "For half a millennia, the House of Armagnac has ruled a small domain in the south of France as loyal subjects of the French king. During the Hundred Years' War, they were instrumentally important in providing aid for stopping the advance of the relentless English armies, especially showing their worth in their steadfast opposition against Burgundian forces. However, after the Hundred Years' War, the Armagnacs grew restless, and began to chafe at the centralization of power under the King of France, thus coming to take on a leading role in forming the League of the Public Weal. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is extremely angry at the betrayal of the Armagnacs, and demands that they be punished savagely for their crimes against the monarchy. Harsh measures will allow us to both claim the lands of Armagnac for the royal domain, and send a clear message to our other subjects that no rebellion will be tolerated."

 ipeFRA.6.t: "The Duchy of Alençon"
 ipeFRA.6.d: "On August 17, 1424, the English armies captured Jean II, the Duke of Alençon in battle. He was forced to pay 200,000 saluts for his ransom, selling all he possessed to the English, including the Duchy of Alençon. However, the Duke of Alençon was not to be defeated yet - when Jeanne d'Arc arrived at Orléans in 1429 and promised victory over the English, the Duke of Alençon eagerly joined her, lifting the Siege of Orléans later that year. Nonetheless, the Duke was devastated when he learned of Jean's martyrdom by the English, wherein she was burnt at the stake.\n\nThe Duke of Alençon has long been dispossessed by our English enemies, and it would be just that we return to him his inheritance in Alençon, however despoiled it has been by the deprivations of the English. Shall we allow the Duke of Alençon to finally return to his long-occupied domain?"
 ipeFRA.6.a: "Yes, let a hero go home."
 ipeFRA.6.b: "Alençon is ours!"
 ipeFRA.7.t: "The Duchy of Berry"
 ipeFRA.7.d: "Upstart nobles are plotting against us, even within the House of Valois which has long ruled France. They have grown tired of the centralizing policies of the French king, and demand concessions in order to appease them. One way we could ease the angst of the nobles is by recreating the title of the Duchy of Berry and offering it to a member of the House of Valois, as a sign of goodwill regarding the intentions of the King of France."
 ipeFRA.7.a: "Surrender the Duchy of Berry."
 ipeFRA.7.b: "Berry is ours!"
 ipeFRA.8.t: "The County of Maine"
 ipeFRA.8.d: "For years, Maine has been occupied by the English despite having been ceded to a member of the House of Valois by René de Anjou in 1441. Now that we have retaken Maine from the English, returning it to control of its rightful noble rulers would appease the nobles of France greatly."
 ipeFRA.8.a: "Let us return the County of Maine."

 ipeFRA.9.t: "The Mines of Paris"
 ipeFRA.9.d: "Since the 13th century, the environs of Paris were mined extensively in order to extract stone from local limestone formations, which was used for construction all over the city. Eventually, three main networks of mines developed, made up of underground tunnels stretching for hundreds of kilometers. However, as the city expanded later on in its history, it began to absorb settlements and suburban areas built atop these mines, which became dangerously prone to collapse. When a Parisian street collapsed 100 feet under into the mines in 1774, the Royal Council decided that it would be necessary to inspect, maintain, and repair the tunnels beneath the city to ensure that such calamities would not happen again.\n\nEstablishing a new citywide organization to oversee the renovation of the mines would greatly improve safety within Paris and make it easier to build new construction in previously mined out areas. Although it would be a fairly costly venture, the mines in their current state present a constant danger to existing buildings and the lives of the Parisian public. What shall we do?"
 ipeFRA.9.a: "Create an organization to inspect the mines!"

 ipeFRA.10.t: "The Catacombs of Paris"
 ipeFRA.10.d: "Recently, we renovated the mines of Paris, doing maintenance, repair, and inspection work on the tunnels to ensure that they would not collapse again. Lately though, we have had problems regarding the local cemeteries, which, having been used for centuries, are now overflowing with millions of corpses. The situation is so severe that the cemetery's oldest corpses, reduced to nothing but skeletons, have been exhumed, and their bones packed into the surrounding roofs and walls. Already, the basement of a building bordering the cemetery has collapsed, filling it with a gruesome collection of decomposing bodies.\n\nCurrently, the Parisian cemeteries are far beyond capacity, constituting a public health and safety crisis. It has been suggested though that we could condemn Paris' urban cemeteries, and instead relocate all the bodies to the mines, perhaps creating an underground series of catacombs for the dead. While this would be an extremely expensive and time-consuming project, involving the moving of millions of bodies, it may be necessary to ensure that the dead are able to rest in peace with any semblance of dignity."

 ipeFRA.11.d: "Sampiero Corso, a Corsican soldier long in the service of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, has come to us with an intriguing proposition regarding the Italian city-state of Genoa. He tells us of dissent on the island of Corsica against Genovese rule, and suggests that if we would support his leading of a military venture on the island, he could secure its independence from Genoa. This is a unique proposition that could help us expand our influence in the Mediterranean."

 ipeFRA.13.t: "The French Toll System"
 ipeFRA.13.d: "In the 17th and 18th century, France had dozens of different laws for how different goods were to be taxed when transported between provinces. To make matters worse, different laws applied to different provinces, causing multiple tolls to be paid by merchants travelling across the country. This not only discouraged trade and transportation, but also made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad rather than from a neighboring city.\n\nIt was up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the 18th century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres' worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, as a consequence of paying for dozens of tolls along the way. The provincial regulations meant that the same amount of salt could cost twenty times as much on one side of a river as on the other.\n\nIf the French economy is to grow and become prosperous, it will be necessary to reform this archaic and backward toll system, so that commerce can flow freely once again."
