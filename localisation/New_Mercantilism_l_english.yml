 new_mercantilism.1.t: "The Price Revolution Begins"
 new_mercantilism.1.d: "From the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th century, Western Europe underwent a phenomenon now known as the Price Revolution, in which countries experienced unprecedented inflation as a result of the large influx of gold and silver from Spanish colonies in the New World. The flow of precious metals through Spain gradually spread through the rest of Europe because of a Spanish balance of payments deficit, enlarging the money supply and price levels of other European countries. Inflation would further be perpetuated by population growth and urbanization, creating a revolution within the global economy."
 new_mercantilism.1.a: "An interesting development."
 price_revolution: "The Price Revolution"
 desc_price_revolution: "A massive influx of New World gold and silver has caused the prices of goods to rise all over Europe."
 new_mercantilism.4.t: "The Beginnings of Slavery"
 new_mercantilism.4.d: "By the time the first Europeans made it to the Americas, slavery was not all a foreign concept to the colonizers. The ruthless conquest and genocide of the Guanche people of the Canary Islands was characterized by extensive slavery, and the first Portuguese forays along the coast of Africa were also used for slave raiding, whose helpless products would be sold in markets of the Christian Mediterranean. However, neither of these bids at economizing slavery were effective in the long term, firstly because the Guanche were too few and secondly because the North Africans were capable of putting up formidable naval resistance.\n\nNonetheless, the Portuguese found a truly permanent source of slaves when they finally discovered the African kingdoms around the Gulf of Guinea, which had long taken captives in their petty wars. The arrival of the Portuguese and then other Europeans only exacerbated conflict in the region by creating an additional economic impetus for slave-driven warfare, whose victims would be sent across the Atlantic to European colonies, aboard crowded and diseased ships far beyond any reasonable capacity for humane transporation.\n\nThe slaves were needed in the New World because the indigenous Americans were all too susceptible to Old World diseases, dying in the millions as they were also enslaved and worked to death on encomiendas and metal-laden mines. The African counterparts of the indigenous Americans fared little better, also dying in the millions, but on the malarial environments of plantations for cash crops like sugar, tobacco, and coffee."
 new_mercantilism.4.a: "Death is meaningless before profits."
 new_mercantilism.4.a.tooltip: "We will use slaves to grow cash crops in this province."
 new_mercantilism.4.b: "We must bring sanity to this barbaric history."
 new_mercantilism.4.b.tooltip: "We will not use slaves in this province."
 new_mercantilism.5.t: "The Absence of Slaves"
 new_mercantilism.5.d: "As a result of the settlement of new people in a location where there was a plantation, the slaves of the province have been displaced or freed, and slavery is now absent from the area."
 new_mercantilism.5.a: "Slavery is an odious institution."
 new_mercantilism.6.t: "The Cruelty of Slavery"
 new_mercantilism.6.d: "There is no shortage of tales regarding the cruelty of slavery in the New World. It was ostensibly for Christianizing purposes and by divine gift that many plantation owners insisted they had the right to own slaves, but in the end they did nothing but perpetuate their own evil.\n\nThe stories of rapes, floggings, and outright murder of slaves on American plantations were not necessarily universal, but nonetheless all too common because slaves had no real legal protection of their own, reliant upon either the mercy or sanity of their masters, both of which were often lacking. In Santo Domingo, there is one anecdotal tale of a slave begging his master not to slice off his ear, because without that ear, the slave insisted his master would no longer be able to stick a cigarette butt in it.\n\nAll across the Americas, slaves began to behave with increasingly aggressive obstinance and indifference toward their masters, as they were increasingly dehumanized and alienated from the world by the intensity of their own suffering. Many slaves took up Christian religion in order to turn its own moralistic words and dictates upon the malevolence of their own masters, to obtain even the slightest of moral victories over those who subjected the slaves to a life in death.\n\nWith centuries of legendary suffering and grievances behind the history of the American slaves, it is no wonder that the first of all slave revolutions, in the modern nation of Haiti, proceeded with such overwhelming and indiscriminate violence."
 new_mercantilism.6.a: "Cash crops cannot be grown by the dead."
 new_mercantilism.7.t: "Importing Slaves"
 new_mercantilism.7.d: "As slaves are only dying constantly in our colonies, from both the grueling nature of their work and the utterly abusive character of their owners, we must import more slaves in order to make up for the intense loss of life. However, doing so will come at a price."
 new_mercantilism.7.a: "This is precious cargo."
 new_mercantilism.7.b: "People are not property."
 new_mercantilism.8.t: "The Slave Uprising in $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 new_mercantilism.8.d: "A long history of unfettered and rapacious violence has always defined the character of $FROMCOUNTRY$, one of the formerly great colonies of $COUNTRY$'s empire, whose value to the world was always built upon the corpses of slaves. However, those who reaped economic benefits by the whip have now been slain with the sickle, with hundreds of thousands of slaves rising up in the lands of $FROMCOUNTRY$, turning vigorously upon their former masters, and cutting them down to nothing, men, women, children, and all.\n\nAdmittedly, it is hard to save those who bring violence upon themselves, and the slave uprising in $FROMCOUNTRY$ may create a situation where we may never be able to manage the colony to its former level of productivity. But as a matter of principle, we should consider retaking the island as a possession."
 new_mercantilism.8.a: "But can we truly condemn the slaves?"

 new_mercantilism.9.t: "The Abolition of Slavery in $COUNTRY$"
 new_mercantilism.9.d: "Previously, $OVERLORD$ acknowledged the grievous horror of slavery, abolishing it in their own country and placing restrictions upon the slave trade. While their humanitarian ideals are commendable, they have now found it fit to condemn slavery within our lands as well, expounding that they have a legal right to do so as our overlord.\n\nClearly, the politicians of $OVERLORD$ have moral convictions, but absolutely no economic sense whatsover, completely failing to understand how much the abolition of slavery will damage our economy. In lieu of $OVERLORD$'s' incredible overreach and hubris, we must consider breaking free of our bonds, and declaring independence so that we can protect our institutions from further damage."
 new_mercantilism.9.a: "And who will grow the sugar?"
 new_mercantilism.10.t: "Slavery Extinguished"
 new_mercantilism.10.d: "We have happened upon a situation where we have seized provinces in which slaves are used to produce material goods, primarily cash crops, for the purpose of profitable exporation elsewhere. As members of a nation which found its roots in slavery, and rebelled against that form of malevolent institution, we of $COUNTRY$ cannot allow this situation to continue. It is time that the slaves of these lands grow free, and add their talents, and most of all, their humanity, to our burgeoning and growing state!"

 new_mercantilism.11.t: "The Conquest of Hispaniola"
 new_mercantilism.11.d: "We have recently conquered land on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, which has a tropical environment highly suited to the cultivation of sugar. Sugar is a resource with an extremely lucrative price, and will sell especially well in Europe because of the difficulty of acquiring sugar from the elsewhere, namely the East Indies. We could make an incredible profit if we would simply import slaves in order to work the plantations of Hispaniola, however many might die of malaria and other conditions related to their bondage."
 new_mercantilism.11.a: "The slaves will make Hispaniola flow with sugar."
