 desc_ulugh_begs_observatory: "In the 1420s, Timurid prince Ulugh Beg ordered the construction of an astronomical observatory in Samarqand, which is now one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world. It was inspired by a similar observatory established in the city of Maragheh in 1259, and hosted a large quadrant capable of measuring the duration of the year, period of the planets, and eclipses."

 ipeTIM.1.d: "Although the era of the Timurid Empire was often remembered for its carnage under the warlord Timur, it can also be remembered for the cultural and academic rebirth that ensued, which constituted its own Islamic renaissance. Persian artistic traits became interwoven with Mongol art, while Samarqand and Herat became focal points for artistic culture as Persian intellectuals moved to these cities in increasing numbers.\n\nTimurid architecture, quality metalwork, Chinese-style ceramics, and Islamic scholarship, especially in fields like astronomy and mathematics, all became defining features of the Timurid Renaissance. These are some of the most glorious days in the history of the Timurid Empire."
