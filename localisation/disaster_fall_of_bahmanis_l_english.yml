 fall_of_bahmanis.1.t: "The Fall of Bahmanis"
 fall_of_bahmanis.1.d: "Since 1347, the Persianate Muslim realm of Bahmanis has ruled over the Deccan, becoming one of the mightiest states in India and a worthy rival of the Vijayanagar Empire to its south.\n\nFor decades, the court of the Bahmani Sultanate has shown favor to the Gharbians, immigrants to the Bahmani Sultanate coming from Persia and the Middle East, who have now long served as viziers, provincial governors, and advisors. The Gharbians have effectively formed their own class of the nobility, becoming extremely wealthy and powerful in their own right.\n\nHowever, the rise of the Gharbians has not pleased everyone. The indigenous Hindu and Muslim nobles, known as the Deccanis, have lamented the importation of foreign influences, both out of an interest to preserve Indian traditions and to protect their own power from the newcomers. Relations between the Gharbians and Deccanis have become especially tense as both have aggressively vied for influence in the court of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, who has found it increasingly difficult to pick a side.\n\nNow, the conflict between the Gharbians and the Deccanis has come to a head, with many on both sides coming to view the Bahmani Sultanate as weak and illegitimate because of its inability to resolve the dispute between the Deccanis and Gharbians. As a result, the country is now in danger of being ripped apart, as lesser nobles put together private armies and take over important Bahmani cities to declare the foundation of their own new kingdoms - the Deccanis and Gharbians will now take matters into their own hands when defending their interests."
 fall_of_bahmanis.1.a: "Dark times for Bahmanis."
 fall_of_bahmanis.1.a.tooltip: "§RDuring the Fall of Bahmanis disaster, nobles will take over many cities of Bahmanis and revolt to declare the independence of brand new kingdoms. We will need to crush these rebels by force.§!"
 fall_of_bahmanis.2.d: "The son of a Hindu Brahmin from Vijayanagar, Ahmad Nizam Shah has long served as the governor of Beed and other districts within the vicinity of the great city of Daulatabad. Thus, Ahmad Nizam Shah took up residence in Junir for much of his life.\n\nAlthough he was long loyal to the Sultan, in the wake of the diminishing legitimacy of the Bahmani Sultanate, Ahmad has found cause to take up arms against the new regime at $CAPITAL$, declaring independence and the founding of a new capital city for his realm at Ahmadnagar. It will take a great effort from $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ in order to cull the ambitions of this powerful military leader."
 fall_of_bahmanis.3.d: "Yusuf Adil Shah was a Georgian slave purchased from Iran. Nonetheless, rumors have asserted that he may be a son of Ottoman Sultan Murad II, or a Turkman of the Aq Qoyunlu.\n\nWhile the stories surrounding Yusuf’s origins are questionable, his power remains undeniable. Yusuf’s bravery and strong-willed personality led the Bahmani Sultan to view him favorably, and thus Yusuf was appointed Governor of Bijapur, promising to wage war against the Vijayanagar Empire.\n\nNonetheless, with the Bahmani Sultanate’s legitimacy at an all-time low, Yusuf Adil Shah has found no reason to maintain his loyalty to the regime at $CAPITAL$. Consequently, he has declared his independence as the new Sultan of Bijapur. If we are to prevent Yusuf Adil Shah from splintering our realm further, we must actively resist his ambitions."
 fall_of_bahmanis.5.d: "Fath Allah was born a Kanarese Hindu, but was captured as a boy by Bahmani forces when they were sent on an expedition against the Vijayanagar Empire. As a result, Fath Allah was brought up as a Muslim, serving the Bahmani Sultans in Bidar. Through the influence of the Bahmani viziers, Fath Allah attained the rank of officer, commanding the forces of Berar and receiving the title ‘Imad Malik.\n\nWith the authority of the Bahmani Sultanate all but collapsing, Fath Allah has declared himself the Sultan of Berar, setting up his capital at Illichpur. As a result, it would now be quite problematic to restore order in the northernmost provinces of Bahmanis."
 fall_of_bahmanis.6.t: "The Assassination Plot"
 fall_of_bahmanis.7.d: "Many of the nobles have long viewed the authority of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ negatively, with their opinion only worsening as the country heads toward a total collapse. While local governors took control of the outlying provinces, conspiring nobles gathered in $CAPITAL$ with a plan to overthrow the $MONARCHTITLE$.\n\nHowever, before the conspirators could descend upon the palace, they were caught by the royal guards, and their plan thus amounted to naught. Now though, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ faces the difficult question of how to treat the rebellious nobles who had just gravely threatened his life. There is merit to be had in either harshness or lenience toward traitors."
 fall_of_bahmanis.7.a: "Order a brutal reprisal."
 fall_of_bahmanis.7.b: "Forgive the nobility."
 fall_of_bahmanis.8.d: "Many of the nobles have long viewed the authority of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ negatively, with their opinion only worsening as the country heads toward a total collapse. While local governors took control of the outlying provinces, conspiring nobles gathered in $CAPITAL$ with a plan to overthrow the $MONARCHTITLE$.\n\nUltimately, the conspirators descended upon the palace, catching the royal guards by total surprise, slaughtering them with a superior force. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ was cornered to his royal chambers with his harem, and in the end, all were unceremoniously executed by means of the sword.\n\nWith their plot a resounding success, the nobles have now organized an even larger revolt in $CAPITAL$. We will have to impose a brutal and painful punishment upon these traitors."
 fall_of_bahmanis.8.a: "Kill them all!"
 fall_of_bahmanis.9.t: "A Powerful Vizier"
 fall_of_bahmanis.9.d: "Many influential viziers have previously led the government of Bahmanis. While Qasim Barid Shah is hardly any different from his predecessors in this position, he presides over the Bahmani government at a unique time in history, amid the collapse of the Sultanate to which he has been ostensibly loyal.\n\nIn these conditions, the nobility has come to view $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ as increasingly inept and incompetent, and whispers have circulated about deposing him, potentially even replacing his rule with that of the vizier Qasim. At this point, we can be certain that Qasim has heard these whispers of treason, and perhaps has already made up his mind to seize power by force if we are to deny it to him.\n\nMaking Qasim Barid Shah the new leader of the country would bring about the end of the Bahmani dynasty, and potentially bring further turmoil to our lands. What should we do?"
 fall_of_bahmanis.9.a: "It is the end of the Bahmani dynasty."
 fall_of_bahmanis.9.b: "The Bahmani dynasty will reign eternal!"
 fall_of_bahmanis.100.t: "Order Restored to $COUNTRY$"
 fall_of_bahmanis.100.d: "At long last, order has been restored to $COUNTRY$, with $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ reaffirming the legitimacy of the ruling dynasty. Nonetheless, many of the Bahmani Sultanate’s most important cities lay in ravages and ruins, being damaged by the travails of war against the insurrectionist nobility.\n\nEven so, $COUNTRY$ will likely emerge ever stronger from the conflict, never again succumbing to the disputes of petty warlords. The Deccanis and Gharbians, henceforth humbled, will be forced to coexist, becoming truly subject to the authority of the $MONARCHTITLE$. The days of the Deccan as one of the most influential regions in Indian politics are not yet over."
