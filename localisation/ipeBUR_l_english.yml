 ipeBUR.1.t: "The Duchy of Guelders"
 ipeBUR.1.d: "On June 25, 1423, Reinald IV, the Duke of Guelders and Jülich died and left no heirs. While the Duchy of Jülich went to his nephew Gerhard VII, the succession to the Duchy of Guelders became disputed, and a new noble dynasty, the House of Egmond, took power in Gelre. While at first the claim of Arnold von Egmond was weak, he managed to successfully appease the local nobility by expanding their privileges, and successfully defended the Duchy against an invasion by Gerhard VII, winning Burgundian support for his cause.\n\nWith our recent defeat at the hands of the Egmonds, it is perhaps time to move on from our claims to the Duchy. Although the Duke of Burgundy has been supportive of the Duke of Guelders, he might be interested in buying our claim to the Gelren lands, to provide himself another opportunity to expand his own power."
 ipeBUR.1.a: "Let us try to dispose of our claims."
 ipeBUR.1.a.tooltip: "We will attempt to sell the claim to the throne of Guelders to Burgundy."
 ipeBUR.1.b: "But Gelre will be ours!"
 ipeBUR.2.d: "On June 25, 1423, Reinald IV, the Duke of Guelders and Jülich died and left no heirs. While the Duchy of Jülich went to his nephew Gerhard VII, the succession to the Duchy of Guelders became disputed, and a new noble dynasty, the House of Egmond, took power in Gelre. While at first the claim of Arnold von Egmond was weak, he managed to successfully appease the local nobility by expanding their privileges, and successfully defended the Duchy against an invasion by Gerhard VII, winning Burgundian support for his cause.\n\nDiplomats from the Duchy of Berg are now offering to sell their Duke's claim to the Duchy of Guelders, which would allow us to claim the territory for ourselves. If we take up this offer, we could become ever more powerful as monarchs of the Low Countries."
 ipeBUR.2.a: "We shall purchase their claim!"
 ipeBUR.2.b: "Sounds troublesome."
 ipeBUR.3.t: "The Duke of Burgundy Claims Guelders!"
 ipeBUR.3.d: "Intrigued, the Duke of Burgundy has taken us up on our offer to sell the claim to the throne of Guelders, agreeing to pay a sizable sum for the right to the land. That said, having a claim to the land and actually owning it are two entirely different matters."
 ipeBUR.3.a: "Best of luck to them."
 ipeBUR.4.t: "The Duke of Burgundy Turns Us Down"
 ipeBUR.4.d: "Recognizing that it might be militarily costly to seize the Duchy of Guelders for himself, the Duke of Burgundy has declined to take us up on our offer to purchase the claim to the Duchy of Guelders, saying that is a matter best left to die. We are surprised that the expansionist monarchs of Burgundy have curbed their ambitions in such a way."
 ipeBUR.4.a: "They are not entirely wrong."
 ipeBUR.5.t: "The Question of Guelders"
 ipeBUR.5.d: "Recently, the Dukes of Burgundy have come into possession of the lands of Utrecht, putting themselves in a preeminent position in the Low Countries. Although the predecessors of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ worked actively in order to stem the colossal growth of Burgundian power, it appears that we have been too late to halt their meteoric rise.\n\n$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is concerned about his safety and the possibility of whether war might break out with Burgundy. As a result, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is contemplating whether the Duchy of Guelders should simply just be sold to the rapacious Duke of Burgundy."
 ipeBUR.5.a: "We should not oppose them."
 ipeBUR.5.a.tooltip: "If the Burgundians take up our offer to sell them the Duchy of Guelders, we will fall under a personal union with them."
 ipeBUR.5.b: "They are of no concern to us."
 ipeBUR.6.t: "The Sale of Guelders"
 ipeBUR.6.d: "Afraid of our growing might following our subjugation of Utrecht, the fearful Duke of Guelders now offers us an opportunity to purchase the Duchy of Guelders entirely, which would make it yet another territory ruled by our dear $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ in personal union. Should we take them up on the offer?"
 ipeBUR.6.a: "It would be a worthy possession!"
 ipeBUR.6.b: "Their fears of us are unfounded."
 ipeBUR.7.t: "Denied the Duchy of Guelders"
 ipeBUR.7.d: "Although the Duke of Guelders briefly contemplated selling his lands in the Low Countries to us, he has now had a change of heart, wishing to preserve the independence of his realm. The Dukes of Burgundy have long dreamed of creating an expansive domain stretching from the Low Countries to the Alps, and acquiring the Duchy of Guelders would only serve to further that ambition. If we are to claim the Duchy of Guelders, we must do so by force of arms."
 ipeBUR.7.a: "We will be ready for war."
 ipeBUR.8.t: "The Duchy of Guelders Sold!"
 ipeBUR.8.d: "Unsurprisingly, the Duke of Burgundy has taken us up on our offer to sell the Duchy of Guelders, paying a sizable sum in return for rulership over the Duchy. We are now subjects of Burgundy, with the last Duke of Guelders moving elsewhere in order to live a peaceful and contemplative life."
 ipeBUR.8.a: "We will serve Burgundy now."
 ipeBUR.9.t: "Burgundy Refuses to Purchase Guelders!"
 ipeBUR.9.d: "To our amazement, the Duke of Burgundy has refused to purchase the Duchy of Guelders, insisting that he poses no threat to our independence. While it will take time to see whether his reassurances are real, we should be grateful for his exercise of restraint despite holding tremendous power."
 ipeBUR.9.a: "We admire their magnanimity."
