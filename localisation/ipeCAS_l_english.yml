 ipeCAS.1.t: "The Kingdom of the Canaries"
 ipeCAS.1.d: "In 1402, the Norman explorer Jean de Béthencourt arrived in the Canary Islands to take control of the archipelago on the behalf of the Kingdom of Castile. With the help of the local Guanche people, he quickly established himself in Lanzarote, before conquering Fuerteventura and El Hierro. Afterward, Pope Innocent VIII proclaimed Béthencourt King of the Canary Islands, in spite of the fact that he still acknowledged Castilian overlordship. Thus, a Christian kingdom was born on the edge of the known world.\n\nNow though, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has different aspirations for the Canary Archipelago, not even necessarily fixated on the idea of kingship. Instead, he has pondered over selling the island to different claimants, most notably the Kingdom of Portugal. If we sold the Canaries to Portugal, it would unquestionably be a great betrayal to the Kingdom of Castile which shed blood to help us conquer these lands in the first place.\n\nWith $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ mulling over the fate of the islands, what should we do?"
 ipeCAS.1.a: "Sell the islands to Portugal."
 ipeCAS.1.b: "Sell the islands to Castile."
 ipeCAS.1.c: "Maintain independence."
 ipeCAS.2.t: "The Fate of the Canary Islands"
 ipeCAS.2.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship, the monarch of the small Kingdom of the Canaries, formally an ally of the Kingdom of Castile, has come to $CAPITAL$, offering to sell his lands to us. We are surprised by his betrayal of Castilian interests, but nonetheless welcome the acquisition of new territory that will only help us expand our dominion over the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.2.a: "Let us keep this new possession!"
 stole_the_canaries: "Stole the Canaries"
 ipeCAS.2.b: "We do not wish to anger Castile."
 returned_the_canaries: "Returned the Canaries"
 ipeCAS.3.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship, the monarch of the small Kingdom of the Canaries we established decades ago has come to $CAPITAL$ to announce that he would like to sell his lands to us. We are surprised by the willingness of this monarch to surrender his kingdom, but nonetheless welcome the acquisition of new territory that will only help us expand our dominion over the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.3.a: "An welcome surprise."
 ipeCAS.4.d: "In 1402, the Norman explorer Jean de Béthencourt arrived in the Canary Islands to take control of the archipelago on the behalf of the Kingdom of Castile. With the help of the local Guanche people, he quickly established himself in Lanzarote, before conquering Fuerteventura and El Hierro. Afterward, Pope Innocent VIII proclaimed Béthencourt King of the Canary Islands, in spite of the fact that he still acknowledged Castilian overlordship. Thus, a Christian kingdom was born on the edge of the known world.\n\nThe monarch of the Canaries has mulled over the islands' fate, and after much consideration, has opted to maintain an independent domain in the waters of the Atlantic. While his claim to a Kingdom of the Canaries is supported by the Pope, both the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have designs upon this region of Macaronesia, which would be a useful base for ships travelling through the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.4.a: "Interesting."
 ipeCAS.5.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship over the Canary Islands, the monarch of the small Canary Island kingdom has decided to sell his lands to our Atlantic rivals in Portugal. This is a shocking betrayal, given that it was Castilian troops who provided the Béthencourt family with the necessary strength to conquer their domain in the Canary Islands decades ago. Even worse however, Portugal has refused to return the Canary Islands to our control, insisting that they are now a Portuguese royal possession. If we are to take the Canaries back, we may have to resort to war."
 ipeCAS.5.a: "Aggravating."
 ipeCAS.6.t: "Rebellion on the Canary Islands!"
 ipeCAS.6.d: "Displeased with the sale of the Canary Islands to Portugal, Castilian, Norman, and Guanche inhabitants on the Canary Islands have joined forces and united against us, aiming to expel Portuguese control from the islands. We now have a large revolt on our hands, and will need to send a substantial military force to deal with it."
 ipeCAS.6.a: "Crush them!"
 ipeCAS.7.t: "The Treaty of Aláçovas"
 ipeCAS.7.d: "For years, the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have been at odds over control of the Canary Islands and various other rights in the Atlantic, which has often brought the two realms close to war. However, war between Castile and Portugal is not inevitable, and could be avoided through shrewd diplomacy. Our control of the Canaries is still a sticking point in the side of the Castilian monarchy, and ceding it to them could save us from a long and extended enmity."
 ipeCAS.7.a: "Let us sign the Treaty of Aláçovas."
 ipeCAS.7.b: "There can only be one master of Iberia!"
 ipeCAS.8.t: "Portugal Signs the Treaty of Aláçovas"
 ipeCAS.8.d: "For years, the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have been at odds over control of the Canary Islands and various other rights in the Atlantic, which has often brought the two realms close to war. Fearful of a war which could cause turmoil across the Iberian Peninsula, the monarchy of Portugal has opted to sign the Treaty of Aláçovas in order to ensure perpetual friendship with Castile, promising to cede control of the Canary Islands and ground on other disputes. It is clear that the Portuguese view us as a friend, and not an enemy."
 ipeCAS.8.a: "May our friendship come to last."
 ipeCAS.9.t: "Portugal Rejects the Treaty of Aláçovas!"
 ipeCAS.9.d: "For years, the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have been at odds over control of the Canary Islands and various other rights in the Atlantic, which has often brought the two realms close to war. The monarchy of Portugal has opted to take an extremely belligerent stance against the Kingdom of Castile, proclaiming our monarchs illegitimate and Portugal as the sole ruler of the Atlantic world. We are awed by this buffooonery, and it is clear at this point that the Portuguese are not our friend, but an enemy."
 ipeCAS.9.a: "The scoundrels!"
 ipeCAS.10.t: "Sugar in Tenerife"
 ipeCAS.10.d: "Before the arrival of our settlers, the Guanche of Tenerife were poor practitioners of agriculture, often suffering from starvation because of their inability to properly irrigate and utilize modern agricultural technologies. However, now that we have arrived on the island of Tenerife, we have found that its climate is suitable for the growing of sugar, just like on the other Canary Islands. We could profit greatly from the construction of sugar plantations on this island."
 ipeCAS.10.a: "Money is a sweetness in itself."
 ipeCAS.11.t: "The Disappearance of the Guanches"
 ipeCAS.11.d: "The Guanches, having been rarely in contact with the people of the mainland, had frail immune systems and were incapable of withstanding native European and African diseases. In addition to that, even against the stipulations of the Pope, many unscrupulous plantation owners enslaved the Guanches, forcing them to work laboriously to the death in order to grow sugar. With the remaining Guanches being largely in hiding, dying, or having assimilated into the new settler population, the original Canarian culture of these islands is effectively extinct. The Canaries are now hardly distinguishable from Spain, albeit hundreds of kilometers south in the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.11.a: "Tragic, but unavoidable."
 ipeCAS.12.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship over the Canary Islands, the monarch of the small Canary Island kingdom has decided to sell his lands to our Atlantic rivals in Portugal. This is a shocking betrayal, given that it was Castilian troops who provided the Béthencourt family with the necessary strength to conquer their domain in the Canary Islands decades ago. However, to our surprise, the Portuguese have acted with goodwill, offering to turn over the islands to us, recognizing our important role in having conquered the islands. Clearly the monarchy of Portugal desires good relations with the Kingdom of Castile, something that can only bode well for us in the future."
