 ipeKOR.1.t: "The Invention of Hangul"
 ipeKOR.1.d: "In the past, the Korean people wrote primarily using Classical Chinese and native phonetic writing systems thousands of years old. Since learning Classical Chinese was difficult, literacy was largely restricted to the upper class and most of Korea was left illiterate, impeding the dissemination of literature and ideas. However, King Sejong the Great of the Joseon Dynasty sought to amend this situation, and thus developed a new Korean alphabet, which would come to be known as Hangul. The project was completed by January 1444, forever changing the Korean language as Hangul entered Korean popular culture. Hangul helped introduce a great enthusiasm for reading among the common people, and is still well-regarded for its phonological faithfulness."

 ipeKOR.2.t: "The Korean Calendar"
 ipeKOR.2.d: "Since time immemorial, the Korean calendar system has largely copied the Chinese one, being based on the longitude of the Chinese capital. However, for the first time in Korean history, the astronomers of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ have developed a new calendar with the Joseon capital of Seoul as its primary meridian. Now, Korean astronomers will predict the timing of solar and lunar eclipses more accurately than they ever have, bringing the people of Korea oncemore in tune with the elements of the universe."
 ipeKOR.2.a: "Reform the calendar!"
 ipeKOR.3.t: "The Plot of the Hall of Worthies"
 ipeKOR.3.d: "In 1420, King Sejong the Great of the Joseon Dynasty established the Hall of Worthies in order to conduct scientific research and pursue technological advancement on the behalf of the monarchy. Among their many innovations included the creation of the Korean calendar system, the invention of a sophisticated rain gauge, and most importantly of all, the creation of the Korean alphabet known as Hangul.\n\nWhile the Hall of Worthies enjoyed great patronage and support under the reign of the enlightened King Sejong, they now chafe at the rule of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, a relatively inept ruler who many of the most gifted scholars in the Hall of Worthies now regard as ignorant and incompetent. In the eyes of these wise men, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is unfit to rule, and at worst even a threat to the country’s future. Many of the scholars in the Hall of Worthies now mull over deposing this unqualified and feeble king…"
 ipeKOR.3.a: "We must heed the advice of the Hall of Worthies!"
 ipeKOR.3.b: "Crush this intransigence!"
 ipeKOR.4.t: "Heo Jun"
 ipeKOR.4.d: "Heo Jun is well-regarded as one of the most prominent physicians hailing from the Yangcheon Heo clan based in Hanseong. Having become a physician at the age of 29, he has written a number of medical texts, of which the most famous has been Dongui Bogam, the Mirror of Eastern Medicine. His works have rapidly diffused to other East Asian countries including China, Japan, and Vietnam, with the Dongui Bogam in particular becoming widely regarded as a classic of Oriental medicine.\n\nIn addition to his services to the royal family of Korea, Heo Jun has strived to make his practices accessible to the common people in order to benefit their healthfulness as well. Instead of using solely rare and expensive ingredients for his various treatments, Heo Jun has also made efforts to incorporate the application of common herbal remedies, with many of them being just as effective as their more costly alternatives. In fact, Heo Jun has gone so far as to write his works in Hangul instead of Hanja to make his knowledge even more usable by the common people."
 ipeKOR.4.a: "He will make an excellent court physician."
