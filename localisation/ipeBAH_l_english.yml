 desc_local_bahmani_capital: "This city has long served as a local provincial capital for the Bahmani Sultanate, with its governor possessing a wide array of powers, including the right to levy local armies and collect taxes. Such powerful local rulers may one day prove to be a threat to the unity of the Sultanate."
 ipeBAH.1.t: "Influx of the Gharbians"
 ipeBAH.1.d: "The Bahmani Sultanate is in many ways a colonial state. The Deccan had only been under Muslim control for 20 years when our ancestors threw off the imperialist yoke at Delhi. The vast majority of our subjects are Hindu Marathas, Kannadigas, and Telugus.\n\nWith northern India closed off to us by the Delhi Sultanate for so long, we have long had to rely on overseas immigration directly from Persia and the Arab World to fulfill the needs of our state, recruiting gifted advisors, generals, and scholars to serve in our government.\n\nAs a consequence, our dynasty has always spent much energy attracting able and learned men to what has become a rather a cosmopolitan kingdom. Nonetheless, since our loss of control over the western coast, this stream of able people has been gradually transformed into a trickle. If we wish to avert a serious crisis in our government, we must double our efforts to lure all men of quality here, no matter the risks."
 ipeBAH.1.a: "Let us double our efforts."

 desc_gharbian_settlement: "The Sultanate of Bahmanis has invited immigrants from Persia and the Arab World to serve in the national government, benefiting the country greatly with their expertise. While local Deccani nobles may chafe at the presence of these foreigners, the Gharbians' positive impact on the running of the country is palpable."

 desc_struggling_government: "Hampered by the loss of its most expert government officials following the loss of the Konkan coast, the Bahmani Sultanate's government is now having trouble running the country efficiently. It will take time for the Sultanate to adjust to its shortage of foreign scholars and polymaths, who had previously brought great benefit to the nation's development."
 ipeBAH.2.d: "The Bahmani Sultanate is in many ways a colonial state. The Deccan had only been under Muslim control for 20 years when our ancestors threw off the imperialist yoke at Delhi.

Now that we have reclaimed control of the coastline, we may once again invite great foreign minds to serve in our court, just as we have always done. If we wish to avert a serious crisis in our government, we must double our efforts to lure all men of quality here, no matter the risks."
 ipeBAH.3.t: "Mahmud Gawan"
 ipeBAH.3.d: "Today, a Persian merchant named Mahmud Gawan arrived in $CAPITAL$ seeking an audience. Given the chance to introduce himself, he explains that he is exactly the kind of person our government needs. Apart from his personal qualities as a trader and administrator, he says that he has a network of contacts all over the Muslim world from which we might benefit.\n\nMahmud Gawan promises that if we give him the means to do so, he would be able to both make our economy flourish and restore our military to primacy once again, making our kingdom so famous that everyone will flock to our shores to serve us.\n\nBy appointing Mahmud Gawan as our vizier, we can make many needed economic and military reforms to our country, strengthening our position on the Indian Subcontinent. However, allowing this foreign Gharbian to take command of the Bahmani government is likely to leave the indigenous Deccani nobility deeply incensed, which could one day prove to be a recipe for disaster."

 ipeBAH.3.c: "We should avoid angering the local Deccani nobles."
 ipeBAH.4.t: "Plight of the Bahmani Pilgrims"
 ipeBAH.4.d: "Since our kingdom lacks a coastline, the journey of the Bahmani pilgrims to Mecca during the Hajj has become especially dangerous, as pirates and other bandits now prowl the seas unhindered, attacking our helpless subjects with impunity. Furthermore, these criminals attacking the pilgrims have also damaged our sea-borne trade, harming the interests of Bahmani merchants as well. If we do not secure control of the coastline for ourselves, these incidents will certainly continue."
 ipeBAH.4.a: "We will soon march to the sea."
 ipeBAH.5.t: "The Centralization of Bahmanis"
 ipeBAH.5.d: "The Sultanate of Bahmanis has long been divided into four provinces, centered around the cities of Daulatabad, Bidar, Mahur, and Gulbarga. Each province has been controlled by a civil governor with near total control of civil and military administration within their respective jurisdictions. As Bahmanis has gradually expanded, the power of each of the four governors has steadily grown, to the point that it may one day pose a threat to the interests of the Sultanate.\n\nIn order to remedy these issues, it has been proposed that we should divide each province in two, take control of all but one of the forts in each province, and tighten central control over provincial employment and payment of troops. Furthermore, taking a large block of crown land in each province would even further diminish the power of the local governors. While the nobility may be angered by these proposals, they would go a long way to serving the needs of Bahmanis."

 ipeBAH.6.t: "Deccanis and Gharbians"
 ipeBAH.6.d: "Our policy of constant outside recruitment has had its drawbacks. Known as Deccanis, second and third generation Bahmani nobles, together with the remaining part of the old Hindu nobility, are increasingly becoming a strong faction at court, advocating for the indigenization of our Sultanate. Against them stand the new immigrants from the west, the Gharbians, who have come to seek a fortune in the rich lands of Asia.\n\nThe court is now quite polarized between the two, and lately they have even been kept apart in our audience chamber and at royal ceremonies."

 ipeBAH.10.d: "For many years now, the policies of Mahmud Gawan, a Gharbian merchant, have guided the country of Bahmanis, bringing it great wealth and a more centralized administration. While Gawan’s reforms have brought immense benefits to the Bahmani Sultanate, not all within the country have been pleased with the changes proposed by the newcomer, who many Deccani nobles regard as a malign foreign influence.\n\nAs a result, the Deccanis have put together a conspiracy to force $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to do away with Mahmud Gawan’s reforms entirely, or otherwise they will take up arms against the government and do their best to bring ruin to the country. In these dire circumstances, we may be forced to turn back on the many achievements of our powerful vizier."

 ipeBAH.11.d: "The son of a Hindu Brahmin from Vijayanagar, Ahmad Nizam Shah has long served as the governor of Beed and other districts within the vicinity of the great city of Daulatabad. Thus, Ahmad Nizam Shah took up residence in Junir for much of his life.\n\nAlthough he was long loyal to the Sultan, following Mahmud Gawan’s deposition of the Bahmani Sultanate, Ahmad has found cause to take up arms against the new regime at $CAPITAL$, declaring independence and the founding of a new capital city for his realm at Ahmadnagar. It will take a great effort from $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ in order to cull the ambitions of this powerful military leader."

 ipeBAH.12.d: "Yusuf Adil Shah was a Georgian slave purchased by Mahmud Gawan from Iran. Nonetheless, rumors have asserted that he may be a son of Ottoman Sultan Murad II, or a Turkman of the Aq Qoyunlu.\n\nWhile the stories surrounding Yusuf’s origins are questionable, his power remains undeniable. Yusuf’s bravery and strong-willed personality led the Bahmani Sultan to view him favorably, and thus Yusuf was appointed Governor of Bijapur, promising to wage war against the Vijayanagar Empire.\n\nNonetheless, now that the Bahmani Sultanate has been deposed, Yusuf Adil Shah has found no reason to maintain his loyalty to the regime at $CAPITAL$. Consequently, he has declared his independence as the new Sultan of Bijapur. If we are to prevent Yusuf Adil Shah from splintering our realm further, we must actively resist his ambitions."

 ipeBAH.13.d: "Before the rise of the Bahmani Sultanate, the region of Telangana was largely ruled by the Musunuri Nayaks, who had previously served as army chiefs for the local Kakatiya dynasty. While the Musunuri Nayaks reunited the various Telugu clans and the region, the Bahmani Sultanate and Vijayanagar Empire eventually defeated the Nayaks, displacing them as a major power.\n\nNonetheless, the Bahmani Sultanate has governed Telangana with a high degree of autonomy since then, depending on powerful nobles to serve as administrators and quell disturbances. Among these nobles has been Quli Qutb Shah, a Turkman from the city of Hamadan in Persia, who has projected significant power from his fort near Golkonda.\n\nWith the Bahmani Sultanate falling apart, Quli Qutb Shah has sensed the opportunity to augment his own power, declaring the independence of a new sultanate based from Golkonda. Ultimately, it will not be easy for us to bring the long-troublesome region of Telangana back under our control."

 ipeBAH.14.d: "Fath Allah was born a Kanarese Hindu, but was captured as a boy by Bahmani forces when they were sent on an expedition against the Vijayanagar Empire. As a result, Fath Allah was brought up as a Muslim, serving the Bahmani Sultans in Bidar. Through the influence of Mahmud Gawan, Fath Allah attained the rank of officer, commanding the forces of Berar and receiving the title ‘Imad Malik.\n\nWith the authority of the Bahmani Sultanate all but collapsing, Fath Allah has declared himself the Sultan of Berar, setting up his capital at Illichpur. As a result, it would now be quite problematic to restore order in the northernmost provinces of Bahmanis."

 ipeBAH.17.d: "The Golkonda Fort and its surrounding settlements have long been a center of power in the Deccan, serving as the capital for various powerful governors and now sultans. However, the city has long been beset by issues related to poor water access, such that it would be prudent to relocate the capital elsewhere.\n\n$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has found a fitting site for a new capital on the banks of the Musi River, which has great potential for growth.
