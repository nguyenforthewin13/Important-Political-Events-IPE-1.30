 vietnamese_civil_war.1.t: "The Vietnamese Civil War"
 vietnamese_civil_war.1.d: "The Vietnamese people have endured the trials and tribulations of many past years restlessly. Continual famine, a declining economy, and inept leadership have brought chaos and turmoil to Vietnam, threatening the hold of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty over the country, and bringing forth the threat of serious revolt.\n\nNow, an influential general in $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s court, Mac Dang Dung, openly quarrels with the royal family and extends his influence around the imperial capital, stirring up a crisis that has now brought the attention of some of the country’s most powerful royal families, including the Nguyên and the Trinh. A showdown will soon begin, which will challenge the legitimacy of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty and its right to the Mandate of Heaven, for only a truly noble and magnanimous soul will have the right to rule all Vietnam."
 vietnamese_civil_war.1.a: "What will become of our dynasty?"
 vietnamese_civil_war.2.t: "The Mac and the Trinh"
 vietnamese_civil_war.2.d: "Two great Vietnamese factions now clash for dominance in Vietnam’s internal affairs. On one hand, the esteemed general Mac Dang Dung, a man of great strength and cunning, has gradually worked his way up through the ranks of the military, becoming one of the most powerful individuals in all Vietnam. He now openly challenges the merits of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s $DYNASTY$ dynasty, claiming that $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has lost the Mandate of Heaven through years of poor action and inadequate rulership.\n\nHowever, the mighty Trinh lords will not step down amid this confrontation, proclaiming their commitment to defend royal power from the rebellious Mac. On their side is the Nguyên family of Thanh Hóa, which has likewise expressed its intent to protect the rights of the current dynasty, refusing to forsake their $MONARCHTITLE$ in these turbulent times.\n\nWith $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ becoming more and more powerless, we are forced to pick a side, which will carry forth the fate of Vietnam through this age of conflicts."
 vietnamese_civil_war.2.a: "Mac Dang Dung will end the corruption of this dynasty!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.2.a.tooltip: "The Trinh and Nguyên supporters of the Emperor will flee south, and ignite an insurrection against the regime of Mac Dang Dung."
 vietnamese_civil_war.2.b: "We will not betray our Emperor!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.2.b.tooltip: "Mac Dang Dung will soon march on the imperial capital, with aims of overthrowing the current dynasty and beginning a civil war."
 vietnamese_civil_war.3.t: "The Trinh-Nguyên Alliance"
 vietnamese_civil_war.3.d: "Alarmed by the sudden deposition of the last $MONARCHTITLE$ by Mac Dang Dung, the powerful noble families of the Trinh and the Nguyên have joined forces, pledging their resistance to the Mac and that they will restore possession of the throne to a claimant worthy of the Mandate of Heaven. Fleeing south, the Trinh and the Nguyên have mustered an army, bracing themselves for the likely prospect of civil war."
 vietnamese_civil_war.3.a: "This upstart regime must be crushed!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.3.b: "§GPlay as Annam.§!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.4.t: "The Mac Dynasty"
 vietnamese_civil_war.4.d: "Unperturbed by the threat of united resistance from the Trinh and the Nguyên, the general Mac Dang Dung marched on the imperial palace at $CAPITAL$, capturing $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ and executing him in a spree of unrestrained violence, bringing much bloodshed to the country’s heart. Mac Dang Dung has proclaimed the birth of a new dynasty under his name, stating that the Mandate of Heaven now rests with him."
 vietnamese_civil_war.4.a: "This is an atrocity!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.4.b: "Play as Tonkin."
 vietnamese_civil_war.5.t: "The Insurrection of the Peasantry"
 vietnamese_civil_war.5.d: "The quarreling between Vietnam’s noble factions and the questionable legitimacy of the dynasty has led to a series of peasant insurrections. It will be necessary to subdue these uprisings in order to return order to the country."
 vietnamese_civil_war.5.a: "Kill them all!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.6.t: "The Displeasure of the Nobility"
 vietnamese_civil_war.6.d: "General Mac Dang Dung has not been the only individual among the noble factions to show great disgust with the ruling dynasty. Many nobles throughout the country, both chafing under the loss of their rights and the injustices of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty, have organized a revolt against royal authority. We will have no choice but to crush it."
 vietnamese_civil_war.6.a: "They should know better than to challenge authority!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.7.t: "Scholars Condemn the Dynasty"
 vietnamese_civil_war.7.d: "Many of our mandarins, who have loyally served us through the reign of many past $MONARCHTITLE$s, are now openly questioning the reign of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, decrying his pettiness and cruelty, going so far as to record their complaints in the country’s historical annals. This can only reflect poorly upon the $DYNASTY$ dynasty’s claim to the Mandate of Heaven."
 vietnamese_civil_war.7.a: "Perhaps they should learn to write facts and not opinions!"
 vietnamese_civil_war.8.t: "The Spreading of Famine"
 vietnamese_civil_war.8.d: "The current era of Vietnamese history has been beset by much strife, some of which has not been the making of man. Famine is quickly spreading throughout the country and causing immense suffering among the peasant population, dealing great damage to the national economy. We can only hope that these hard times will eventually pass."
 vietnamese_civil_war.8.a: "Heaven will one day smile upon us yet again."
 vietnamese_civil_war.100.t: "The Fracturing of Vietnam"
 vietnamese_civil_war.100.d: "Multiple dynasties now lay claim to the Mandate of Heaven, with Vietnam viciously divided between factions north and south, either side regarding the other with deep-seated hostility. While the Mac may have proved their force of arms in deposing the lax and ineffective Emperor, their legitimacy as an upstart dynasty still remains in question, for the capacity to wage violence alone is not among the defining qualities of a truly righteous ruler.\n\nForeign powers may view the ongoing dynastic struggle in Vietnam with great interest, and it is therefore inevitable that the reunification of the country will only come about through true sacrifice."
 vietnamese_civil_war.100.a: "We will one day again rule a united country."
 vietnamese_civil_war.100.a.tooltip: "The future of Vietnam will be significantly defined by the ongoing conflicts between the Trinh, the Nguyên, the Lê, and the Mac."
