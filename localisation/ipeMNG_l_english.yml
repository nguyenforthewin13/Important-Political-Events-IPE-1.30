 guard_battalion_system: "The Guard Battalion System"
 desc_guard_battalion_system: "For its entire history, the Ming Dynasty employed the guard battalion system in order to defend its frontiers. Most Ming soldiers came from military households which comprised 20% of the households in Ming China, which provided their own food through military farms and rotated posts frequently. While the guard battalion system outsourced the job of organizing the military from the imperial capital to the provinces, it also made the Ming military extremely inefficient, as soldiers were poorly paid and constantly demeaned by their superiors in the civil service, thus making soldiering by far the least prestigious profession in the Ming Dynasty. Soldiering also paid extremely poorly, and officers commonly seized military colonies to transform them into private estates, therefore making the soldiers working them their serfs. If the Ming military is not reformed in due time, it will one day become utterly incapable of fending off greater threats to the security of China."

 desc_upgraded_fortifications: "By upgrading the fortifications along the Great Wall and elsewhere, we have ensured greater security for the Middle Kingdom, protecting it from foreign incursions by nomads and other enemies.

 desc_projected_chinese_power: "There are now many nations which aim to threaten the supremacy of the Middle Kingdom. However, our army remains as strong and large as it has ever been, and will surely preempt any foreign attempt to challenge us."
 professionalized_the_army: "Professionalized the Army"
 desc_professionalized_the_army: "The army has been professionalized, doing away with the inefficient military colonies and hereditary soldiering of the guard battalion system. For the first time in history, China has developed a real and formidable standing army, which is not just built from disorganized peasant conscripts drafted on the spur of the moment."
 stamped_out_corruption: "Stamped Out Corruption"
 desc_stamped_out_corruption: "With all fundamental reforms having been made to the Imperial Chinese government, we have finally stamped out the last vestiges of corruption in the guard battalion system, making the Chinese army the equal to or even superior to those of peers all around the world. No longer will soldiers be able to bribe their way out of drilling."
