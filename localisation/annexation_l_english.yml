 annexation.1.t: "Collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate"
 annexation.1.d: "In 1515, Sultan Selim I began the war which led to the Ottoman conquest Egypt and its dependencies. Mamluk cavalry proved no match for the Ottoman artillery and Janissary infantry. On 24 August 1516, at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, Mamluk Sultan Al-Ghawri was killed. Syria passed into Turkish possession, an event welcomed in many places as deliverance from the Mamluks. The Mamluk Sultanate survived in Egypt until 1517, when Selim captured Cairo. Although diminished in power, the Mamluks were retained by the Ottomans as an Egyptian ruling class, and the Burji family succeeded in regaining much of its influence.\n\nThe Mamluks are incredibly corrupted, and leaving them in privilege will do naught for Egypt. Nonetheless, without their support, we will be unable to rule this region as easily. What should we do?"
 annexation.1.a: "We shall rule Egypt directly."
 annexation.1.a.tooltip: "The Ottomans will annex the entirety of the Mamluk Sultanate. The Ottomans will gain cores on all Mamluk core provinces, but all Mamluk provinces of Egyptian culture will gain the Mamluk Influences province modifier for 200 years."

 annexation.2.t: "The Fall of Novgorod"
 annexation.2.d: "Throughout the 14th century, Lithuania and Muscovy fought intensely for control of Novgorod and its extravagant wealth, accrued from control of the lucrative fur trade in the Russian north. As Muscovy grew in strength, its princes became an increasingly greater threat to Novgorod. Thus, the Novgordians began to turn to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for security, pursuing an alliance in the 1470s. However, this encouraged the wrath of Muscovy, and so Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan III went to war with Novgorod and took the city in 1478 - he destroyed the Veche bell, the ancient symbol of Novgorod's republican traditions, and ended the independence of Novgorod. \n\nA Muscovite onslaught has the potential to instill incredible fear, horror, and anger among the once free and prosperous Novgorodian people. Should Muscovy seize the lands of the north?"

In 1467, Uzun Hasan, the Shahanshah of the Aq Qoyunlu, defeated Jahan Shah, the Sultan of the Qara Qoyunlu at the Battle of Chapakchur. Jahan Shah was slain in battle and the Qara Qoyunlu promptly collapsed, with their lands being rapidly subsumed by their rivals. \n\nShould we seize the territories of our enemies?"

However, Ardabili forces have now sacked the Qara Qoyunlu capital, bringing great ruin and devastation to that country. Consequently, the Qara Qoyunlu state now teeters upon the brink of collapse.\n\nIf $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ were to take control of the lands of the Qara Qoyunlu, he would be able to transform $COUNTRY$ into one of the most dominant forces of a new Middle East.

In 1467, Uzun Hasan, the Shahanshah of the Aq Qoyunlu, defeated Jahan Shah, the Sultan of the Qara Qoyunlu at the Battle of Chapakchur. Jahan Shah was slain in battle and the Qara Qoyunlu promptly collapsed, with their lands being rapidly subsumed by their rivals. \n\nThe ruler of the Qara Qoyunlu has now perished in battle with the forces of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, bringing the Qara Qoyunlu state to the brink of collapse. It is time for the White Sheep to fill the power vacuum."
 annexation.7.t: "The Conquest of Ajam"
 annexation.7.d: "For many years, the lands of Ajam were under the rule of a branch of the Timurid dynasty. However, in recent times, the rulers of Ajam broke away from the Timurid sphere of influence, thus depriving themselves of the protection provided by their former overlords.

 annexation.11.t: "The Fall of Jaunpur"

The Nasrid dynasty governed the Emirate from their seat of power at the Alhambra palace complex in the capital city of Granada, which was a cultural gemstone of the Islamic world, flourishing on the trade route between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. However, now Christian forces have seized control of the city, defeating the armies beyond it, overwhelming its walls, and swarming in through the gates.
