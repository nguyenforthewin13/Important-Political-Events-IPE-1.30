The country entered an interregnum dominated by the hooded confederations of nobles, who exercised control in each region of the country. In the end, the Polish nobles decided that they would elect the next King of Poland, deciding to do away with the instruments of hereditary monarchy and establishing an elective monarchy in its place.\n\nWith the death of our last Jagiellon monarch, anarchy reigns in the country.

 ipePOL.7.t: "The Henrician Articles"
 ipePOL.7.d: "In 1573, the Polish nobility elected Henri de Valois, the younger brother of King Charles IX of France, as monarch, hoping that Henri would support their cause against foreign enemies and pursue good relations with his home country. However, they also worried that Henri would take away the privileges the nobility had long enjoyed, and so forced him to sign a contract that would become later known in history as the Henrician Articles.\n\nThe Henrician Articles effectively served as the constitution of Poland's elective monarchy, underlining that the monarchy was no longer to be hereditary, and that the szlachta nobility of Poland would elect the monarchs of the country from that point onward. Moreover, the monarch's powers to raise taxes and make either war or peace were greatly restrained, needing the approval of the Sejm, Poland's parliamentary body. These restrictions would prove especially straining for later Polish monarchs, and perhaps contributed to Henri's flight from Poland when his brother Charles IX died in 1574, leaving the throne of France open for him.\n\nThe nobles are now demanding that $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ sign a contract to guarantee them their rights and privileges in perpetuity. However, doing so could greatly weaken $COUNTRY$ forever, and leave the country vulnerable to the whims of the magnates. What should we do?"

 ipePOL.3480.t: "The Pacta Conventa"
 ipePOL.3480.d: "While the Henrician articles served as the permanent consitution of Poland's elective monarchy, each monarch upon accession also had to agree to a a pacta conventa, a contractual agreement underlining the policies and goals the king would pursue following his election to the throne. For example, the pacta conventa of Wladyslaw IV Vasa detailed that he would direct the Commonwealth's resources toward the construction of a permanent navy in the Baltic Sea. While the pacta conventa ostensibly gave the king latitude in specific areas of economic, military, and cultural policy, it also greatly empowered the nobles and the Sejm, further allowing them to impede later monarch's efforts at ruling and developing the country.\n\nCurrently, the magnates demand that $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ sign a new pacta conventa following his accession to the throne of $COUNTRY$. What goals should we undertake under the terms of this pacta conventa?"

 ipePOL.3738.d: "After signing the Henrician Articles and the pacta conventa, the king held little power of his own. As consequence, the king became reliant on the Sejm to make war and peace with the country's enemies. On occasion, the king would attempt to force the Sejm to comply to his demands out of necessity, sometimes building domestic political coalitions for desired effect. Nonetheless, the Sejm's refusal was often obstinate."
 ipePOL.9.t: "Bribing the Sejm"
 ipePOL.9.d: "In 1573, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth became an elective monarchy once its new king Henri de Valois signed the Henrician Articles forcefully imposed upon him by the powerful magnates of the country. One of the stipulations of the article was that the king would effectively become subservient to the Sejm, needing to abide by its consensus on all the country's policy decisions. However, beginning in the 17th century an insidious new device of parliamentary procedure began to appear in the workings of the Sejm - the liberum veto. The liberum veto was effectively the unlimited power of any single noble within the entire Sejm to completely cancel its proceedings, even during session, not only preventing the passage of new legislation but also nullifying all legislation that had been passed up to that point.\n\nWhile not all meetings of the Sejm would be paralyzed by the liberum veto, its effects gradually grew worse as foreign powers began to key in on the inefficiency it produced. Many of the Commonwealth's rivals, primarily Russia and Prussia, would bribe officials within the Sejm to utilize the liberum veto in order to ensure the destruction of all legislation they found themselves at odds with, especially any legislation aimed at reforming the woefully powerless government of the Commonwealth. From 1573 to 1763, of the 150 times the Sejm was convened, 53 resulted in no legislation being passed because of the exercise of the liberum veto. Toward the final days of the Commonwealth, the liberum veto forced the state to collapse into sheer and absolute anarchy, strongly contributing to the final outcome of the Partitions of Poland.\n\nWe now have a unique opportunity to completely paralyze the proceedings of the Sejm if we would generously bribe one noble to utilize the liberum veto. This would tremendously weaken our Polish rival, and frustrate all their attempts at strengthening the country."
 ipePOL.9.a: "We will bribe one of these magnates."

 ipePOL.10.t: "The Sejm Vetos All Policies"

We bribed one of the Polish magnates, and as expected, he made use of the liberum veto to completely cancel all the proceedings of the Sejm, both preventing the passage of further legislation and nullifying all which had been previously accomplished. We can only laugh at the administrative ineptitude of our rivals, who have embarrassingly allowed the magnates to obtain such an absurd amount of power over the affairs of $FROMCOUNTRY$. As long as the nobles of $FROMCOUNTRY$ continue to hold the liberum veto, we will be able to entirely cripple their nation."

 ipePOL.11.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Bribes the Sejm"
 ipePOL.11.d: "It has just come to our notice that the nation of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has bribed one of the nobles in the Sejm to exercise the liberum veto, the power to completely nullify all of the Sejm's proceedings and legislative progress. While the magnates are openly discussing the implications of this undeniable act of treason, they seem unwilling to do anything about it and are uninterested in reform that would prevent this from happening again, touting the importance of the liberum veto to their rights, and instead simply opting to cancel parliamentary procedure and go home. Unless something is done about the practically unlimited power of the liberum veto to paralyze all government initiatives within the country, we will find ourselves helpless to combat our enemies."
 ipePOL.11.a: "Worrying."
 ipePOL.12.t: "The Sejm Ratifies All Policies"
 ipePOL.12.d: "To our dismay, our efforts to bribe the Sejm of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been for naught, as it has ratified all of the monarch's policies in its most recent session. Evidently, the magnate we bribed chose not to honor the deal he had made with us, as he did not paralyze the Sejm's proceedings with the liberum veto. Nonetheless, it is likely that we will once again have an opportunity to induce paralysis upon the government and internal workings of $FROMCOUNTRY$."

 ipePOL.13.t: "The Beginning of the Liberum Veto"
 ipePOL.13.d: "A sinister new power has risen in $COUNTRY$ - that of the liberum veto, or the unlimited ability of any single noble in the country's parliament, the Sejm, to cancel the entire body's proceedings, nullifying all legislation either already passed or up for consideration during a given session of the Sejm.\n\nIt is somewhat unclear when the magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth began to first exercise the liberum veto in the meetings of the Sejm, but most indications suggest that the liberum veto was first exercised in the middle of the 17th century, in order to halt the proceedings of the Sejm beyond a statutory time limit.\n\nWhatever the case, the first use of the liberum veto set a dangerous precedent, because from there on out it was used by individual nobles to entirely cancel the proceedings of the Sejm mid-session to ensure the obstruction of policies they personally opposed. Later on in the liberum veto's history, foreign powers like Russia and Prussia began to bribe the Sejm's officials to exercise the liberum veto in order to impede government reform in the Commonwealth, keeping the country weak in the face of growing foreign threats.\n\nThe liberum veto was used to cancel one third of the Sejm's meetings during the elective history of the Commonwealth, putting the nation in a condition of anarchy, decay, and ruin. Unquestionably, the liberum veto played a critical role in reducing the Commonwealth's status from that of a great power to eventual subjugation and conquest by its neighbors during the Partitions of Poland.\n\nUnless the right of liberum veto is somehow revoked from the country's nobles, there is an intense danger that each meeting of the Sejm may become paralyzed entirely, potentially crippling our efforts at advancement. Only time will tell how $COUNTRY$ will cope with the advent of the liberum veto."

Although the power of the liberum veto often paralyzed the parliamentary proceedings of the Commonwealth, its imposed paralysis was not absolute. The monarch had the power to organize Grand Compromises in order to ensure an at least partially acceptable outcome, stymying the the nobles' fetish for using the liberum veto as a symbol of their personal involvement in the affairs of the Commonwealth, which guaranteed their privileges and freedoms. Even in the face of these great odds though, sometimes the Sejm and the monarch could come to a consensus regarding what would be best for the fate of the country."
 ipePOL.3744.t: "The Sejm Vetoes All Policies"
 ipePOL.3744.d: "The Sejm has failed to ratify even a single one of the policies proposed by $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, totally curbing his ambitions to pursue an agenda that would develop and modernize $COUNTRY$. Even before the advent of the liberum veto, the interests of the magnates who participated in the Sejm were often at odds with the interests of the monarch, leading to considerable political dissension and deadlock. However, once the liberum veto was implemented, entire sessions of the Sejm could be thrown off the rails by so much as a single noble announcing that he did not agree with the continuation of the proceedings. This has become another one of those times where the Sejm has absolutely failed to reach any sort of consensus on matters regarding the future of the country."

By 1525, Albert had also met Martin Luther, who suggested that Albert should reject the authority of the pope and seize the lands of the Teutonic Order, secularizing them into his own duchy.\n\nThus on February 10, Albert made a personal oath to King Sigismund I of Poland, and declared himself the Duke of Prussia. As a result, Albert made history, becoming the first ruler to establish Lutheranism as the state religion of his lands.

Although the Livonian Brothers of the Sword formed a mighty military order, it was decisively defeated by an alliance of Samogitians and Semigallians at the Battle of Schaulen in 1236, resulting in grievous losses for the Brothers. Thereafter, the remnants of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword were reorganized into the Livonian Order, which became an autonomous branch of the nearby Teutonic Order in Prussia.\n\nIn the next centuries, the Livonian Order conquered Courland, Livonia, and Semigallia, buying the Duchy of Estonia from King Valdemar IV of Denmark. The Livonian Order remained a strong and potent offshoot of the Teutonic Order until the latter's decline following the Battle of Grunwald against Poland and Lithuania in 1410. From that point on, the Livonian Order maintained a precarious existence independent of the declining Teutonic Order.\n\nHowever, under $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, the Teutonic Order has climbed to new heights, going so far as to reclaim Samogitia from the Lithuanians.
