 ipeJAP.1.t: "The Bun'an Era"
 ipeJAP.1.d: "Although the Japanese people ceremonially acknowledge the divine supremacy of Emperor Go-Hanazono, it is all but too well known that real political power in Japan rests in the hands of the Ashikaga Shogunate, which crushed the last vestiges of Imperial power following the brief Kenmu Restoration in 1338. The Shogunate is, for all intents and purposes, a military dictatorship governing Japan under the Ashikaga clan, and yet its power is far from absolute.\n\nWhile the Shogun does possess immense and wide-reaching authority, in reality the provinces are dominated by formidable and semi-independent feudal landlords known as daimyo, who hire samurai to protect their vast, hereditary holdings. However, these daimyos are prone to petty disputes and common feuds, which occasionally escalate into outright war.\n\nThe Ashikaga Shogunate has been far from immune to the troublemaking of the upstart daimyos. In 1441, the Akamatsu clan perpetrated the assassination of the sixth shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori, catching him off guard during an evening play, where an armor-clad warrior cut down and beheaded him. Although an alliance of loyal daimyos cooperated with the shogunal army and eventually crushed the Akamatsu clan, forcing its leader to commit suicide, the damage to shogunal authority was immense.\n\nFollowing Yoshinori's death, his eight year-old son Yoshikatsu was established as the next shogun. However, Ashikaga Yoshikatsu switfly died only two years later in 1443, being fatally injured in a fall from a horse. In the wake of this tragic accident, Yoshikatsu's even younger brother, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, was appointed as shogun, and now is the sole authority over all of Japan, at least in theory.\n\nWhile Ashikaga Yoshimasa may for now enjoy a peaceful and blissful childhood at the shogunal residence in Kyoto, the tides of unrest have begun to rise in Japan. The signs of growing political instability now creep upon the islands, perhaps foretelling of a future where Japan will become bitterly engulfed in endless civil war."

 ipeJAP.3.t: "The Kanto Kubo"
 ipeJAP.3.d: "In 1333, the rule of the Kamakura Shogunate, which had lasted for more than a century, finally came to a bloody and unceremonious end. The absolute destruction of the city of Kamakura and the annihilation of the Hojo family ushered in a brief three-year period of imperial rule known as the Kenmu Restoration, which was then swiftly followed by the establishment of the Ashikaga Shogunate. While the Ashikaga shoguns ruled from Kyoto, they continued to assign family members to govern the Musashi Province, where those formerly associated with the Kamakura regime still held strong feelings of independence and resentment toward the Kyoto Ashikaga. From this time onward, the Ashikaga governors of the region would become known as the Kanto kubos.\n\nThe double-headed power structure of the Ashikaga family ruling from both Kyoto and Kamakura was inherently unstable, and in 1439 Shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori sent an army to the Kanto, forcing Kanto kubo Ashikaga Mochiuji and Mochiuji's eldest son Ashikaga Yoshihisa to kill themselves. Afterward, the Musashi Province would come to be governed by the Uesugi clan, faithful allies of the shogunate.\n\nWhile the history of the Kanto region under Ashikaga rule has been strained and troubled, there is still hope that we can restore our family to prominence in Musashi, and more stably assert shogunal influence in the area. One son of the last Kanto kubo Ashikaga Mochiuji, Ashikaga Shigeuji, still lives, and while the province has been governed by the Uesugi clan ever since Mochiuji's death, we could nonetheless reestablish Ashikaga family rule there by allowing Shigeuji to assume the title of Kanto kubo. Perhaps Shigeuji will forgive us, despite our role in his father’s brutal death many years ago."
 ipeJAP.3.a: "We should allow Shigeuji to reclaim his heritage in Kanto."
 ipeJAP.3.a.tooltip: "Ashikaga Shigeuji will be instated as the shogun's deputy in Kamakura. However, we would be taking a great risk by placing faith in a man we have previously wronged."

Ashikaga Shigeuji, son of the previous kubo Mochiuji, still lives, and while the province has been governed by our clan ever since Mochiuji’s death, at the behest of the Ashikaga, we will allow Ashikaga Shigeuji to reclaim his heritage in the Kanto. We have been asked to watch over Shigeuji’s activities on the Shogun’s behalf, and thus will agree to protect his new domain in Kamakura.\n\nAlthough the forces of the Uesugi clan played an important role in bringing about the defeat and ultimate death of Ashikaga Mochiuji many years ago, we can hope that Shigeuji will forgive us in spite of that sad and unfortunate fact."

The Ashikagas before us added even more weight to the Uesugi name by appointing their head as Kanto kanrei, making them effectively the chief administrative officers of the wealthy region.\n\nRelations between us and the Uesugi have become strained as a result of our conflicting interests and authority over the Kanto. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ believes that it would be a good idea to invite [UES.Monarch.GetTitle] [UES.Monarch.GetName] to a mansion in $CAPITAL$ in order to have a timely discussion about political intrigue and local affairs, and to smooth out potential misunderstandings.

Indeed, we have dominated the Kanto ever since we assisted the Ashikagas in overthrowing the late Kamakura Shogunate, afterward becoming invested with the title of Kanto Kanrei, which made us effectively the chief administrative officers of this wealthy region.\n\nIf we wish to avoid straining our relations with the powerful and influential Kanto kubo, we should consider taking up his offer to visit him in his mansion at [KMK.Capital.GetCapitalName], and agree to his wish to have a timely discussion about political intrigue and local affairs.

Their origins are so murky that it is even alleged that the Chosokabe are descendants of ancient Chinese monarch Qin Shi Huang, who built the first iteration of the Great Wall.\n\nAfter the rise of the Ashikaga Shogunate, the Chosokabe clan was brought nearly to extinction by their much more powerful adversaries, the Hosokawa, and forced into refuge on the island of Shikoku, protected by the Ichijo clan. For a time, the Chosokabe served as loyal vassals of the Ichijo, who have long been one of the wealthiest and most landed clans on Shikoku. However, the weakening of the $COUNTRY$ clan’s authority has now created a power vacuum on the island, which the Chosokabe have been all too quick to exploit, seizing total control of the Tosa Province.\n\nThe Chosokabe clan are a formidable foe, tested by centuries of trials and tribulations. If we wish to regain full possession of Shikoku, we must triumph on the field of battle against them."

 ipeJAP.26.d: "While many of the Japanese clans claim descent from gods, the Mori do not. They are proud to look back on their ancestor Oe Hiromoto, a loyal and honorable retainer of the Minamoto clan from which almost all other clans claim lineage.\n\nThe Mori have long been one of many vassals of the Ouchi clan, ruling from their base in Aki Province at the mountain fortress of Yoshida-Koriyama, which they have possessed since the 14th century. Historically, the Mori have been a difficult political position, being forced to contend with not only the Ouchi, but also the powerful Amago and Takeda of Aki.\n\nIn spite of these limitations, the new head of the Mori, Mori Motonari, aspires to one day extend his control across the Chugoku, and become the most powerful daimyo in all of Japan. Many obstacles stand in the way of this rising clan, but the proud Mori Motonari is all the more determined to overcome them."

Long ago, the heads of these two great clans, Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Mochitoyo, reached an accord in order to forestall the advent of conflict between each other - Hosokawa Katsumoto married the daughter of Yamana Mochitoyo, becoming his son-in-law, while also adopting Yamana Mochitoyo’s youngest son as his heir.\n\nShould Hosokawa Katsumoto die, a kinsman of the Yamana would take control of the vast Hosoakwa domains, thus newly uniting the Hosokawa and Yamana clans by blood. However, if Hosokawa Katsumoto comes to sire an heir, his past agreement with Yamana Mochitoyo may be thrown into disarray."

In the aftermath, Yamana Mochitoyo and an army raised by loyal daimyos defeated Mitsusuke in battle, forcing him to commit suicide on September 25.\n\nThe Yamana clan was greatly rewarded by the Shogunate for its services, taking custody of all the former Akamatsu lands, including the province of Harima. Such a quick conquest of these extensive domains rapidly pushed the Yamana toward becoming one of the most powerful clans in Japan, rivaling even the mighty Hosokawa and creating apprehension between them both.\n\nWhile the Akamatsu no longer control any territory, their clan still exists, served by its faithful retainers, who have not wavered even amid the last several years of crisis. Sensing the growing divisions between our clan and the Yamana, the Akamatsu have petitioned that we help restore them to power in the Harima Province, and thus aid in the reconquest of these lands from the Yamana.\n\nSupporting the restoration of the Akamatsu would inevitably bring us into armed conflict with the Yamana.

Always, they have been close to the Shogun in their capacity as Kanrei, the Shogun’s deputy - nonetheless, this unique circumstance of a succession crisis may provide us with the perfect opportunity to break Hosokawa ties with the Shogunate and finally grow more powerful than the Hosokawa. Backing a rival heir to the Ashikaga Shogunate could radically change the Japanese balance of power in our favor, and at long last make the Yamana the greatest of all clans in western Japan."

 ipeJAP.94.a: "Make sure that there are no survivors."
 ipeJAP.95.t: "The Rise of the Azai"
 ipeJAP.95.d: "As longtime vassals of the Kyogoku clan, the Azai have served as gunji, or district managers of the Omi Province. Over time, the Azai grew their influence over local affairs, eroding the authority of the Kyogoku family as shugo-daimyo, becoming the dominant force within Omi.\n\nWith the Omi Province slowly slipping away from our grasp, we are now forced to contend with the steadily increasing might of the Azai, who already seek out further alliances in order to secure their rule. To regain control of the Omi Province would mean waging war against this upstart family."
 ipeJAP.95.a: "We cannot stop the ascent of the Azai."
 ipeJAP.95.c: "§GPlay as Azai.§!"
 ipeJAP.96.t: "The Rise of the Saito"
 ipeJAP.96.d: "The story of the Toki clan as one of Japan’s great royal families begins with their aid to Ashikaga Takauji, the first ruler of the Ashikaga Shogunate, in his campaign to defeat the rebellious Southern Court based at Yoshino. Since then, the Toki have been the main faction in the Mino Province, situated strategically in the middle of Honshu.\n\nNow though, the Mino Province is in danger of descending into bitter civil war, as a new foe to the Toki has arisen - the Saito clan, led by Saito Dosan, who has already made himself known emphatically as the \"Viper of Mino.\" While Saito Dosan was originally a monk and seller of oil, he now has mustered a mighty army, and proclaimed his intention to become among the most eminent of the Sengoku daimyo, beginning with his conquest of Mino."
 ipeJAP.96.a: "We cannot stop the ascent of the Saito."
 ipeJAP.96.c: "§GPlay as Saito.§!"
 ipeJAP.97.t: "The Rise of the Miyoshi"
 ipeJAP.97.d: "The Miyoshi clan is one of the many Japanese families claiming descent from the Seiwa Genji of the Minamoto clan, the Miyoshi themselves being a cadet branch of the Ogasawara and the Takeda. Since the 14th century, the Miyoshi have held a constant presence on the island of Shikoku, serving as one of the most formidable vassals of the even mightier Hosokawa clan.\n\nHowever, great unrest now stirs in the Awa Province, as the Miyoshi have begun to sense the growing weakness of the ruling $COUNTRY$ clan. In this moment of opportunity, Miyoshi Nagayoshi has seized the initiative, declaring his independence and thus joining the ranks of the countless Sengoku daimyo. Ultimately, it will be difficult to stop the ambitions of this fierce and ambitious ruler."
 ipeJAP.97.a: "We cannot stop the ascent of the Miyoshi."
 ipeJAP.97.c: "§GPlay as Miyoshi.§!"
 ipeJAP.98.t: "The Rise of the Matsumae"
 ipeJAP.98.d: "For thousands of years, the Japanese people have traded with the inhabitants of the northern island of Hokkaido, trading rice and iron to the peoples of the island. In more recent times, the Japanese began to settle on the Oshima Peninsula, but thus entered into many disputes with the island’s native peoples, the Ainu, which occasionally escalated into war.\n\nThe Matsumae clan, observing our many troubles on the island of Hokkaido, now comes to us offering its services. The head of the clan, Matsumae Yoshihiro, states that he would be willing to govern this unruly northern region, protecting the frontiers of Japan from foreign invasion and further conflicts with the Ainu tribesmen.\n\nIt may not be so unwise to outsource the problematic issues of the north to our eager subjects, who could extend our form of feudal rule further into new lands."
 ipeJAP.98.a: "The Matsumae would serve as reliable guardians in the north."
 ipeJAP.98.a.tooltip: "All provinces in Hokkaido owned by the Shogun or subjects of the Shogun will be ceded to the Matsumae clan."
 ipeJAP.98.b: "We do not need the services of the Matsumae."
 ipeJAP.99.d: "For thousands of years, the Japanese people have traded with the inhabitants of the northern island of Hokkaido, trading rice and iron to the peoples of the island. In more recent times, the Japanese began to settle on the Oshima Peninsula, but thus entered into many disputes with the island’s native peoples, the Ainu, which occasionally escalated into war.\n\nThe Matsumae clan, observing the Shogunate’s many troubles on the island of Hokkaido, approached the government at Kyoto, offering their services to the Shogun. The head of the clan, Matsumae Yoshihiro, states that he would be willing to govern this unruly northern region, protecting the frontiers of Japan from foreign invasion and further conflicts with the Ainu tribesmen.\n\nUltimately, the Shogun has decided to grant control of the Hokkaido to the Matsumae clan, seizing our possessions on the island and instead granting them to this new family of upstarts."
 ipeJAP.99.a: "Those lands belong to us!"

 desc_treaty_of_gyehae: "The Treaty of Gyehae was signed in 1443 between the Joseon Dynasty of Korea and the So clan based on the island of Tsushima. In return for the So clan's promise to restrain piracy based from their home island, the Joseon Dynasty agreed to open up their ports to trade from the So clan, allowing a limited number of trade ships to come to Korea every year. Ultimately, the monopoly the So clan held on trade with Korea made them one of the wealthiest clans in Japan."
