 ipeSHY.1.t: "Death of Shah Rukh"
 ipeSHY.1.d: "The Uzbek Khanate is an emergent force on the steppes of Central Asia, being one of several polities forged from the ruins of the Golden Horde during the 15th century. Only united by Khan Abu’l Khayr Shaybani in the year 1428, the Uzbeks have become a dominant military power on the plains, subjugating Siberia and bringing countless local tribes under a new common banner.\n\nThe Timurid princes have not been immune to the expansionist ambitions of the Shaybanids, suffering numerous raids throughout the Khwarezm and Transoxiana, reminiscent of those carried out by Timur half a century prior. However, up until this point, the Uzbeks have not been able to truly contest the firm Timurid grip over the wealthiest lands of Central Asia, being held in check by the armies of the great Timurid monarch Shah Rukh, whose renown is hardly less than that of his feared and respected father.\n\nBut now, the recent death of the elderly and enlightened Shah Rukh has forever altered the balance of power in the region. Shah Rukh once ruled the Timurid lands with an iron fist, but now that he has perished, the ambitions of the squabbling lesser princes he once held in check have begun to tear the empire apart.\n\nIt is clear that the status quo in Timurid lands will no longer continue, for many ravenous warlords will now vehemently contest the claim to a united Timurid inheritance. While the Timurid princes may continue to quarrel, this only presents the perfect opportunity for the Uzbeks to finally move south, and perhaps even seize the old Timurid capital at Samarqand…"
 ipeSHY.1.a: "We move in search of greener pastures."
 ipeSHY.2.t: "A Southern Capital"
 ipeSHY.2.d: "In 1428, Chimgi-Tura was named the capital of the Uzbek Khanate following the conquest of western Siberia. However, our southward raids have gradually placed us in a better position to project military power upon the sedentary peoples of the settled south, such that one day we may want to be closer to the inhabitants of this region. As a result, it may be fitting to move our capital south to Syghnak, which could one day be a bustling Central Asian city in its own right."
 ipeSHY.2.a: "It is time we find a new home."
 ipeSHY.2.b: "We cannot stray too far from the lands of old."
 ipeSHY.3.t: "The Sibir Khanate"
 ipeSHY.3.d: "Abu'l-Khayr Shaybani was elected as Khan of Sibir in 1428, beginning his ascent as one of the most formidable monarchs of Central Asia. In the time since then, the Uzbeks have moved their capital away from their ancient homeland around Chimgi-Tura, thus loosening their hold over the lands of Sibir.\n\nSibir has gradually drifted away from the new leadership at $CAPITAL$, and a new Khan of Sibir has been thus proclaimed. It is now up to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ whether he would like to maintain his claim to the lands of the far north, or otherwise abandon them for good."
 ipeSHY.3.a: "Our reign over the Sibir Khanate has come to an end."
 ipeSHY.3.b: "The Uzbek Khanate is indivisible!"
 ipeSHY.4.t: "The Uprising of the Kazakhs"
 ipeSHY.4.d: "Several tribes displeased with the rule of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ have fled the country in an event that has come to be known as the Great Migration, settling on the outskirts of our realm and establishing an independent state. These tribes now call themselves the Kazakhs, protesting the ineffective and disunited rule of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, seeking to break away from what they see as an ineptly governed country.\n\nWhile we may enforce our authority upon these rebellious tribesmen, doing so may come at great cost. Even if it is for the greater good, we may come to regret felling our former kinsmen on the field of battle."
 ipeSHY.4.a: "These dissidents must be crushed!"
 ipeSHY.4.b: "Let them go free."
 ipeSHY.4.c: "§GPlay as Kazakh.§!"
