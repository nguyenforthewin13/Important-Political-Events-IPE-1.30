 ipePOR.1.t: "Wine in Madeira"
 ipePOR.1.d: "Although Madeira was once one of the world's largest producers of sugar, expansion of global commerce has shrunk Madeira's role in the global market for sweet flavorings. However, the people of Madeira have now found it increasingly profitable to produce wine, which is just as eagerly consumed by the peoples of continental Europe, who remark with effusive positivity upon the high quality of Madeira wine. It appears that even in the absence of sugar plantations, Madeira will still be able to economically prosper."
 ipeFRA.1.a: "Wonderful."
 plantations_of_madeira: "Plantations of Madeira"
 desc_plantations_of_madeira: "The sugar plantations of Madeira are among the most productive in the entire world, yielding an extremely large portion of the European supply of sugar. Until new locations for sugar cultivation are acquired elsewhere, Madeira will continue to serve as a tremendous boon to the Portuguese economy."
