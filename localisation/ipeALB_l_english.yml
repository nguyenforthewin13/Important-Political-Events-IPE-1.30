 ipeALB.1.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta"
 ipeALB.1.d: "Signed on March 26, 1451 between Alfonso V of the Kingdoms of Naples and Aragon and the ambassadors of Skanderbeg, the Treaty of Gaeta stipulated that Skanderbeg would recognize the suzerainty of Aragon, in return for support against the Ottoman Empire. Alfonso V aimed to restore Neapolitan influence in Albania, which had disappeared with the fall of the Angevin Kingdom of Albania. However, Albania never truly came under Alfonso's suzerainty, because Skanderbeg declined to fully recognize Alfonso's overlordship until the Ottoman threat was gone, a condition which was never fulfilled in his lifetime. \n\nShould we propose to the Albanians a treaty that could prospectively make them our vassals?"
 ipeALB.1.a: "Yes, send diplomats to make this offer."
 ipeALB.1.b: "No, it is unnecessary to our interests."
 ipeALB.2.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta"
 ipeALB.2.d: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent us diplomats proposing that we accept an alliance with their country, to protect ourselves from the Ottomans. We would get men and arms to assist in the defense of our country, but this would come under the condition that we become vassals of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as soon as the Ottoman threat has left Albania. It is true that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a powerful country whose help might save us from Turkish tyranny. \n\nHow should we respond?"
 ipeALB.2.a: "Accept the treaty."
 ipeALB.2.b: "We do not need help from foreigners."
 ipeALB.3.t: "Albania Accepts the Treaty of Gaeta"
 ipeALB.3.d: "The Albanians have accepted our proposition, and they will become our subjects if the Ottoman threat is driven from their homeland. Our diplomacy is an astounding success."
 ipeALB.3.a: "We will protect this new friend!"
 ipeALB.4.t: "Albania Refuses the Treaty of Gaeta"
 ipeALB.4.d: "The Albanians have refused our proposition, fearing that they would one day lose their independence to us. Our diplomacy has failed, and the leaders of Albania have chosen to fight the Turks alone."
 ipeALB.4.a: "They are defenseless before the Turks."
 ipeALB.5.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta"
 ipeALB.5.d: "Now that the Ottoman forces have been driven out of Albania, we must reconsider the Treaty of Gaeta and our obligations to those who helped us during those hard years of war. Should we fulfill our obligations of vassalage?"
 ipeALB.5.a: "Let us make good on our promises."
 ipeALB.5.b: "Albania shall know no foreign rulers."
 ipeALB.6.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta Honored"
 ipeALB.6.d: "The grateful Albanians have honored the Treaty of Gaeta, telling our diplomats that they are willing to become subjects of our nation. They are pleased to fulfill the terms of the treaty they signed many years ago."
 ipeALB.6.a: "All is well."
 ipeALB.7.t: "The Treaty of Gaeta Dishonored"
 ipeALB.7.d: "The treacherous Albanians have refused to honor the Treaty of Gaeta, telling our diplomats that they will live under neither our own nor Ottoman rule. They scoff at the treaty they signed many years ago. Nonetheless, we can force them to recognize our overlordship."
 ipeALB.7.a: "Their transgressions will not go unpunished."
