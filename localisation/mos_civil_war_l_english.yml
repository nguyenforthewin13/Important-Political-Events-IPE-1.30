 MOS_civil_war.1.t: "The Muscovite Civil War"
 MOS_civil_war.1.d: "On May 19, 1389, the Grand Kniaz of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy died, leaving behind his son Vasily I as successor. However, Donskoy also willed that if Vasily died in infancy, then Vasily's brother, Yury Dmitrievich of Zvenigorod, would become Grand Kniaz. Although Yury posed no direct threat to Vasily I during his reign, problems quickly arose at the beginning of Vasily II's rule. The existing rule of succession outlined that the oldest living brother, which was Yury Dmitrievich, should receive the crown, and not Vasily II, who was Vasily I's son and therefore second-in-line to the throne.\n\nIn 1433, Yury sought to pursue his rightful claim, and marched his armies upon Moscow, entering the city and proclaiming himself Grand Kniaz. But after Yury's sudden death, Vasily II was able to regain control of Moscow and secure an unstable peace wih Dmitry Shemyaka, the Kniaz of Galich-Mersky, and more importantly, a son of Yury Dmitrievich. While the two maintained an uneasy peace for a decade, Dmitry refused to come to Vasily II's aid even when the forces of the Kazan Khanate invaded Muscovy, pressing a claim to the Muscovite throne by right of his father Yury.\n\nWith the loyalties of Dmitry Shemyaka uncertain, and the Khanate of Kazan's armies rallying to the east, the future of Muscovy is dark and uncertain. We must now defend both the throne and our nation..."
 MOS_civil_war.1.a: "Troubling times for Moscow."
 MOS_civil_war.1.a.tt: "We may soon be attacked again by the Khanate of Kazan."
 MOS_civil_war.2.t: "The Qasim Khanate"
 MOS_civil_war.2.d: "Ever since its founding in 1438, the Khanate of Kazan has strived to reclaim those lands which were formerly under the overlordship of the Tatars. One such land is Qasimov, currently under Muscovite control, but still inhabited by our kinsmen in language and faith. With the Muscovite Civil War now raging, we have a new opportunity to seize these lands from the enfeebled government of Vasily II."
 MOS_civil_war.2.a: "Qasimov must be ours."
 MOS_civil_war.2.b: "It is Muscovite land now."
 MOS_civil_war.2.tt: "Any Muscovite refusal of our demands for Qasimov will be met with a declaration of war."
 MOS_civil_war.3.t: "The Qasim Khanate"
 MOS_civil_war.3.d: "Although the Khanate of Kazan is only a young state, its early life has been characterized by unlimited territorial and military ambition. We have already clashed in the past with the Kazan Khanate, and now have received envoys from the Khan, who demand that we cede the territories of the Qasim Khanate to their control. If we refuse to comply, the Kazanis will respond with war. How should we respond to these demands, $MONARCHTITLE$?"
 MOS_civil_war.3.a: "We will not be pressed by infidels!"
 MOS_civil_war.3.b: "Concede to their demands."
 MOS_civil_war.4.t: "Muscovy Denies Qasimov"
 MOS_civil_war.4.d: "Outrageously, the impudent Muscovites have openly defied our demands for control of the Qasim Khanate. Even in the midst of their civil war, the Muscovites are bold enough to oppose us. We will follow through with our promises, and declare a war to end the Muscovite state once and for all."
 MOS_civil_war.4.a: "This is the end of Rus'!"
 MOS_civil_war.4.a.tt: "Muscovy will be met with war!"
 MOS_civil_war.5.t: "Muscovy Concedes Qasimov"
 MOS_civil_war.5.d: "Although it was assumed that Muscovy would fight for Qasimov, in the end the Grand Kniaz yielded to our demands, perhaps realizing the untenable nature of the situation. As a result, we have regained the rightful Tatar territory of Qasimov, and liberated its people from the rule of the infidels.\n\nHowever, we now face question of what to do with this newly acquired land. Qasim Khan, the son of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, is eager to take ownership of this addition to our empire."
 MOS_civil_war.5.a: "Qasim will rule the steppes!"
 MOS_civil_war.5.b: "We will take Qasim for ourselves!"
 MOS_civil_war.6.t: "The Muscovite Throne"
 MOS_civil_war.6.d: "On May 19, 1389, the Grand Kniaz of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy died, leaving behind his son Vasily I as successor. However, Donskoy also willed that if Vasily died in infancy, then Vasily's brother, Yury Dmitrievich of Zvenigorod, would become Grand Kniaz. Although Yury posed no direct threat to Vasily I during his reign, problems quickly arose at the beginning of Vasily II's rule. The existing rule of succession outlined that the oldest living brother, which was Yury Dmitrievich, should receive the crown, and not Vasily II, who was Vasily I's son and therefore second-in-line to the throne.\n\nIn 1433, Yury sought to pursue his rightful claim, and marched his armies upon Moscow, entering the city and proclaiming himself Grand Kniaz. But after Yury's sudden death, Vasily II was able to regain control of Moscow and secure an unstable peace wih Dmitry Shemyaka, the Kniaz of Galich-Mersky, and more importantly, a son of Yury Dmitrievich. While the two maintained an uneasy peace for a decade, Dmitry refused to come to Vasily II's aid even when the forces of the Kazan Khanate invaded Muscovy, pressing a claim to the Muscovite throne by right of his father Yury.\n\nThe Muscovite state is still in a position of instability, with the Grand Kniaz's hold weak and Dmitry’s only growing stronger. Perhaps it is time that the throne of Muscovy finally return to its rightful owner."
 MOS_civil_war.6.a: "I am the Grand Kniaz of Rus'!"
 MOS_civil_war.6.a.tooltip: "If we occupy the capital of Muscovy, we will become Muscovy's new rulers. However, we will lose the Muscovite Civil War if Dmitry Shemyaka dies before that, or if Muscovy occupies Galich, after which Galich will become a part of Muscovy."
 MOS_civil_war.6.b: "We should back down."
 MOS_civil_war.7.t: "Dmitry Shemyaka Rebels!"
 MOS_civil_war.7.d: "Following the death of Yury of Zvenigorod, Dmitry Shemyaka pressed his claim to the Muscovite throne, occasionally entering open conflict with Vasily II. However, for many years, it was possible to maintain a fragile and yet meaningful peace, which allowed the Muscovite lands to recover from a state of turmoil.\n\nHowever, this peace was not to last. Dmitry Shemyaka, perceiving $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to be weak, has finally announced an open rebellion, proclaiming that he will wage war to the very end in order to seize his birthright as Grand Kniaz of Rus’. He has rallied a great army in the principality of Galich-Mersky, and it is only inevitable that he will soon come marching upon Moscow..."
 MOS_civil_war.7.a: "Like father, like son."
 MOS_civil_war.7.a.tooltip: "Dmitry Shemyaka will be defeated if he dies before the conclusion of the civil war, or if the capital of Galich is occupied by Muscovy. But if Dmitry Shemyaka captures the capital, he will become the new ruler of Muscovy and we will lose the game."
 MOS_civil_war.8.t: "Dmitry Shemyaka Stands Down"
 MOS_civil_war.8.d: "Following the death of Yury of Zvenigorod, Dmitry Shemyaka pressed his claim to the Muscovite throne, occasionally entering open conflict with Vasily II. However, for many years, it was possible to maintain a fragile and yet meaningful peace, which allowed the Muscovite lands to recover from a state of turmoil.\n\nTo surprise of everyone in the Grand Principality of Muscovy, it now appears that this peace is indeed to last. Despite prior evidence to the contrary, Dmitry Shemyaka is now announcing absolute loyalty to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ as the ruler of all Muscovy. Whether Dmitry Shemyaka has crafted this peace out of naked self-interest or goodwill remains to be seen, but it is an important step forward in the history of Muscovy."
 MOS_civil_war.8.a: "We are more than fortunate."
 MOS_civil_war.9.t: "Dmitry Shemyaka's Rebellion"
 MOS_civil_war.9.d: "Claiming his birthright to the Muscovite throne through his father Yury Zvenigorod, Dmitry Shemyaka has rebelled against the Grand Kniaz of Muscovy. Although we are but humble princes of Mozhaysk, we have long been on good terms with Shemyaka, and would be rewarded greatly if we were to aid him in his revolt."
 MOS_civil_war.9.a: "Shemyaka's cause is just!"
 MOS_civil_war.9.a.tooltip: "If we occupy the capital of Muscovy, Dmitry Shemyaka of Galich will become Muscovy's new ruler. However, if Muscovy occupies our capital, we will lose the Muscovite Civil War, and Mozhaisk will become a part of Muscovy."
 MOS_civil_war.9.b: "We will stand down."
 aid_muscovite_civil_war: "Came to Our Aid"
 MOS_civil_war.10.t: "Mozhaysk Rebels!"
 MOS_civil_war.10.d: "The Principality of Mozhaysk has emerged in open rebellion, joining forces with Dmitry Shemyaka of Galich, supporting his bid for the Muscovite throne. Mozhaysk will now make open war against us!"
 MOS_civil_war.10.a: "They will be crushed!"
 MOS_civil_war.11.t: "War Taxes"
 MOS_civil_war.11.d: "The prosecution of the ruthless wars against the enemies of Muscovy and $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has had a draining and grievous impact on the national treasury. Furthermore, the people grow increasingly weary of war, wishing for a return to peace. While we could levy heavier taxes on the population, doing so could incite a vicious revolt."
 MOS_civil_war.11.a: "We need the money."
 MOS_civil_war.11.b: "Leave them alone."
 MOS_civil_war.12.t: "The Fall of Moscow"
 MOS_civil_war.12.d: "At long last, the forces of Dmitry Shemyaka have marched into Moscow triumphant, seizing the city's kremlin and announcing Shemyaka as the Grand Kniaz of Muscovy. The population, weary from decades of conflict, has no desire to resist further, and Shemyaka's takeover of Muscovy seems complete."
 MOS_civil_war.12.a: "The civil war ends."
 MOS_civil_war.13.t: "The Flight of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.13.d: "At long last, we have taken back control of the Principality of Galich-Mersky, Dmitry-Shemyaka's main territory, and stymied all the efforts at revolt there. Now sensing the untenability of his situation, Shemyaka has fled abroad, with his armies left in disarray, plundering mercilessly and haphazardly along their path of retreat. If we do not want to experience further insurrections, it is best that we pursue Shemyaka and finish him off once and for all."
 MOS_civil_war.13.a: "Looking for him we will go."
 MOS_civil_war.14.t: "The Pursuit of Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.14.d: "Our agents have finally ascertained the location of the rebel Dmitry Shemyaka, finding his new quarters within the city of Novgorod. We have multiple options through which to dispose of him, but the first and foremost would be to assassinate him by means of poison. Ending Shemyaka's life would bring a definitive end to our raging Civil War, and bring peace to Muscovy once and for all."
 MOS_civil_war.14.a: "Poison him!"
 MOS_civil_war.14.a.tooltip: "We will try to assassinate Shemyaka. However, it is far from certain that our efforts will succeed."
 MOS_civil_war.14.b: "Spare his life."
 MOS_civil_war.15.t: "Question of Qasim Sovereignty"
 MOS_civil_war.15.d: "Despite the Qasim Khanate being governed by Khans, the Muscovites have begun to interfere more and more in the affairs of the Khanate to the point where internal politics are controlled from Moscow. With Kazan seemingly in no state to oppose our de jure control, we can propose that we take over as overlords of Qasim, albeit with something to give them in return."
 MOS_civil_war.15.a: "Seize the opportunity to take control of the Khanate!"
 MOS_civil_war.15.a.tt: "We will present Kazan with a proposal to vassalise the Qasim Khanate for §Y100§! ducats."
 MOS_civil_war.15.b: "Drop the matter."
 MOS_civil_war.16.t: "Question of Qasim Sovereignty"
 MOS_civil_war.16.d: "Even though Muscovy acknowledged our rule over the Khanate of Qasim some years ago, it seems that they are still attempting to gain influence in their court. Today a Muscovite delegation presented us with a proposal - hand control of the Qasim Khanate over in exchange for an adequate sum of gold. Depending on our situation this may bring long-term benefits, so long as the Muscovites do not later use it to their advantage..."
 MOS_civil_war.16.a: "The gold is probably worth more than the Khanate..."
 MOS_civil_war.16.a.tt: "Muscovy will acquire the Khanate of Qasim for §Y100§! ducats."
 MOS_civil_war.16.b: "We cannot allow the Muscovites to interfere in the affairs of Qasim!"
 MOS_civil_war.16.b.tt: "Muscovy will receive news of their proposal being declined."
 MOS_civil_war.17.t: "Muscovy Acquires the Qasim Khanate"
 MOS_civil_war.17.d: "We have successfully convinced the Khan of Kazan that we are the true overlords of Qasim. Control shifted peacefully - that is, except for a group of Tatar serfs who would rather be ruled by their own kind."
 MOS_civil_war.17.a: "Qasim returns to the fold once more."
 MOS_civil_war.18.t: "Kazan Refuses Our Proposal"
 MOS_civil_war.18.d: "Despite our best efforts, the Khan of Kazan was not swayed by a bag of gold, instead demanding that the Muscovite governors be expelled from the Qasim Khanate. This has complicated our attempts to recover Kasimov, as well as relations with the two Khanates for the time being."
 MOS_civil_war.18.a: "Maybe next time, Tatars..."
 MOS_civil_war.19.t: "The Death of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.19.d: "Dmitry Shemyaka has perished, and with him all competing claims for the throne of Muscovy. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ now reigns supreme in the Grand Principality, and is the foremost claimant to the title of Grand Kniaz of Rus'."
 MOS_civil_war.19.a: "This is the end of the rebellion."
 MOS_civil_war.20.t: "The Death of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.20.d: "Dmitry Shemyaka has perished, and with him all competing claims for the throne of Muscovy. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ now reigns supreme in the Grand Principality, and is the foremost claimant to the title of Grand Kniaz of Rus'."

 MOS_civil_war.21.a: "Blessed times for Muscovy."
 MOS_civil_war.22.t: "The End of Galich"
 MOS_civil_war.22.d: "Dmitry Shemyaka's Principality of Galich has been absorbed, meaning that he no longer has a power base from which to oppose us. The dispossession of Shemyaka has effectively ended the Muscovite Civil War, finally bringing peace to Muscovy as $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ now is the strongest claimant to the title of Grand Kniaz of Rus'."
 MOS_civil_war.22.a: "Blessed times for Muscovy."
 gather_rus_enabled.tooltip: "We can now use the "Gather Rus'" diplomatic interaction in order to forcibly integrate our appanages of East Slavic culture."
 MOS_civil_war.69.t: "The Demise of Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.69.d: "We are fortunate in that the cunning of our agents has secured the untimely but welcome death of Dmitry Shemyaka, as we bribed Shemyaka's cooks to poison him. No longer will we have to contend with his false line of Muscovite princes."
 MOS_civil_war.69.a: "Well deserved."
 MOS_civil_war.70.t: "Shemyaka Lives!"
 MOS_civil_war.70.d: "As a consequence of the incompetence of our spies, the dastardly Shemyaka has managed to escape death, this time fleeing to Lithuania in search of safer refuge following our failed attempt on his life in Novgorod. Furthermore, the agents' allegiance to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ was exposed, damaging our reputation. To add further insult to injury, some rebellious members of the nobility have now risen up, promising to enact revenge on us for our dishonorable actions. The civil war is not over yet."
 MOS_civil_war.70.a: "They have forfeit their lives!"
 MOS_civil_war.71.t: "Triumph in the Muscovite Civil War"
 MOS_civil_war.71.d: "We have emerged from the Muscovite Civil War victorious, and aided significantly in Dmitry Shemyaka's capture of Moscow. Shemyaka is extremely grateful for our timely aid, and as a result the Principality of Mozhaysk will be rewarded handsomely from the spoils."
 MOS_civil_war.71.a: "Our loyalty will not be forgotten!"
 MOS_civil_war.72.t: "The Capture of Mozhaysk"
 MOS_civil_war.72.d: "We have captured Mozhaysk, and finally ended the rebellion there, forcing its monarch to flee to Lithuania. With our great victory here, an ally of Dmitry Shemyaka is defeated, and the Principality of Mozhaysk will finally come under the direct influence of Moscow."
 MOS_civil_war.72.a: "A glorious triumph for Rus'!"
 MOS_civil_war.73.t: "Mozhaysk Supports Us!"
 MOS_civil_war.73.d: "The monarch of Mozhaysk has announced his support for Dmitry Shemyaka in overthrowing the weak and petty Grand Kniaz of Muscovy. Despite the long-winded and ruthless nature of the Muscovite Civil War, it is good to see that we still have allies we can count on in our time of hardship. The sacrifices of Mozhaysk will not be forgotten."
 MOS_civil_war.73.a: "To arms, my brothers!"
 MOS_civil_war.73.a.tooltip: "If Mozhaysk captures the capital of Muscovy, Dmitry Shemyaka will become the Grand Kniaz of Muscovy."

 MOS_civil_war.101.d: "While the history of Muscovite-Kazani relations has been characterized by constant and ruthless conflict, it appears that the Khan of Kazan will now back down regarding his claims to the land of Qasim. He states that he was merely testing the strength of the Muscovite state, but it appears that we have called his bluff.
