 KSB_idea_1: "Testament of Boleslaw Wrymouth"
 KSB_idea_1_desc: "The 1138 will of Boleslaw III, called 'Wrymouth' for his deformed jaw, divided the recently-strengthened Kingdom of Poland amongst his sons. It was from this division that all polish Duchies emerged, setting in motion centuries of internal conflicts and intrigues. We owe our existence to Boleslaw's vision."
 KSB_idea_2: "Ethnic Backgrounds"
 KSB_idea_2_desc: "Before the unification of Poland into one Christian state, there were Slavic tribal units in its present lands. The Silesians, Mazovians, Vistulans, Polans, and Pomeranians were the main powers, and they each live on now in the names of our duchies. Though the distinctions have blurred, we are essentially nominal ethnostates."
 KSB_idea_3: "The Seniorate"
 KSB_idea_3_desc: "Boleslaw's testament didn't just divide Poland - it decreed a system of hierarchy, with one province centered on Kraków known as the 'Seniorate', as it was always ruled by the oldest heir and had nominal suzerainty of the other states. To push our interests, we could perhaps bend these rules and find some claim to senior privileges ourselves."
 KSB_idea_4: "Ties With the Germans"
 KSB_idea_4_desc: "Poland's interaction with the German Holy Roman Empire was extensive, though obviously strongest in the east and south. The Silesian duchies entered into a vassal relationship with Bohemia, while the Pomeranians joined the Empire as well under the influence of Brandenburg. These ties mean our royal houses have extensively intermarried, and our trade relations are tight."
 KSB_idea_5: "Divide for Appanage"
 KSB_idea_5_desc: "After the original division of Poland, the sub-duchies were again divided into even smaller territories. Kujavia emerged from Mazovia, Greater Poland produced Kalisz, Gniezno, and various smaller states. In the end, the smaller dukes had less power projection but could more closely administer their lands."
 KSB_idea_6: "Magdeburg Law"
 KSB_idea_6_desc: "The Magdeburg Laws were perhaps the most important in medieval European administration, dealing with the autonomy and rights of individual cities. Under these laws, Poland was urbanized with more modern infrastructure and thousands of villages were founded. Even major preexisting cities like Poznan benefited from the introduction of these laws."
 KSB_idea_7: "Janusz Mazowiecki"
 KSB_idea_7_desc: "Janusz III was the last of the Piast dukes to rule in Poland before being subsumed into the Royal realm. Despite his death, the duchy retained autonomy under its rebellious nobles under 1576, when it was fully integrated by the Jagiellons. We must ensure that our state maintains its own freedoms, and that ambitious monarchs will not bend us to their will."

 copernican_revolution: "Copernican Revolution"
 copernican_revolution_desc: "Nicolaus Copernicus' affirmation that the Earth revolved around the Sun, and not the other way around, helped ignite a renaissance of scientific thinking and advancement within the Commonwealth.

Galich's economic influence will cement its role as one of the leading trade hubs in the region, outcompeting its rivals through reputation and commerce rather than brute strength."
 GLC_idea4: "The Fur Trade"
 GLC_idea4_desc: "Salt is not the only good available to us for trade, as the many furs that arrive to us from the east are in high demand on the European market. These new trade routes for fur as well as the recently introduced commerce of fish ensure our goods will reach faraway lands, increasing our renown considerably."
 GLC_idea5: "Kazani Raids"
 GLC_idea5_desc: "As open war broke out between the principalities of Russia and the Kazan Khanate to the east, the lands of Galich were subjected to heavy damage because of the Kazani incursions into the region. However, thanks to our newly erected fortifications, they will never be able to take the city itself."
 GLC_idea6: "Orthodox Monasteries"
 GLC_idea6_desc: "Many monasteries dot the landscape in and around Galich. The most noteworthy one among them remains the Paisiev Monastery, founded in the early 14th century, featuring a 16th-century five-domed cathedral, and a three-domed church from 1642. It is thanks to these wonderful monasteries that our people feel united in their faith."
 GLC_idea7: "On the Offensive"
 GLC_idea7_desc: "With the Kazan threat neutralized, the importance of Galich as a defensive position declined.
