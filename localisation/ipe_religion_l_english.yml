The Druze themselves are fairly isolationist and prefer to be left alone.\nIn the game, the Druze are a religious minority present in the Levant."

 ipe_religion.1.t: "Harmonization of the Druze Faith"
 ipe_religion.1.d: "The Druze of the Middle East pose a fascinating case for us, as they detached themselves from the Islamic faith while revering figures and philosophies from other cultures and doctrines. With our pluralistic viewpoint towards religions and philosophies, we have found to share much in common with the Druze, and now they have begun noticing it as well. Taking our [Root.GovernmentName] as a role model, their spiritual leaders have called on the Druze faithful to respect our laws and practices and cooperate fully with our government."
