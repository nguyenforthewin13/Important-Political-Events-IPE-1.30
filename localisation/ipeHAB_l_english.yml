 ipeHAB.2.d: "With the country about to disintegrate after the disastrous battle of Varna, the death of King Wladyslaw and the loss to the Ottomans, a diet was called together in an attempt to unite the country again. The division was almost unmanageable and anarchy was close."
 ipeHAB.4.t: "The Death of Ladislaus Postumus"
 ipeHAB.4.d: "Upon his death in 1439, Albert the Magnanimous bequeathed many titles to his son Ladislaus, who had yet to be born and thus received the cognomen \"Postumus.\" Among these titles were the Archduchy of Austria, the Kingdom of Bohemia, and the Kingdom of Hungary - however, Ladislaus' rule only became widely recognized within Austria, where the Duke of Styria, Friedrich III, governed in his stead as regent.\n\nAlthough the Hungarians elected Wladyslaw III of Poland to serve as their new king, he quickly perished in the Battle of Varna, plunging all the lands he ruled into dynastic turmoil. At the same time, the Czech nobility refused to recognize Ladislaus' claim, and so Bohemia underwent an interregnum.\n\nWith the death of Ladislaus Postumus at a very young age, the question of the succession to the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary remains ever more uncertain, and the dynastic claim to these realms now falls upon the other branches of the Habsburg dynasty. No one knows for sure how the death of Ladislaus Postumus might influence the future of Central Europe."

However, the early and unfortunate demise of Ladislaus Postumus now marks the end of the Albertine Line, bringing Lower Austria under the control of the Elder Ernestine Line, which already rules in Styria.\n\nIn addition to holding the Duchy of Austria, Ladislaus was the titular ruler of many other territories spread throughout Europe, including the Kingdom of Hungary, whose fate is now uncertain.

 ipeHAB.15.d: "Ladislaus Postumus, the titular Duke of Austria, has now come of age. For many years until now, the Duchy of Austria was governed by Friedrich III von Habsburg of Styria, Ladislaus' uncle and regent. However, the nobles of the Duchy of Austria were not pleased in having to answer to the court of Styria, and longed for the return of native rule. As a result, the nobles of the Duchy of Austria now demand that we return Ladislaus Postumus to them, so that he can finally take up his rightful role as the monarch of their country."

However, now that Ladislaus has come of age, Friedrich III has refused to allow Ladislaus to return to the lands of Austria, undoubtedly hoping to keep the Duchy of Austria under his own personal control.

He has gathered many supporters in his homeland, and now has proposed an alliance to the Sublime Porte, asking for our help.

Consequently, Friedrich III of Styria became Sigismund's regent, taking advantage of the rich Tirolean silver mines until 1446. However, Friedrich III also waged an unpopular war to regain Habsburg lands in Switzerland, supporting the rebellious canton of Zürich in the Old Zürich War, wherein the Swiss Confederacy promptly triumphed. As a result of these issues, the nobles of Tirol began to demand that Sigismund be allowed to take the throne in Tirol.\n\nThe Tirolean nobles, chafing at $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s governance of Tirol, have grown restless and desire a return to local authority.

At that point though, the nobles of Tirol had already forced Sigismund to practically abdicate, ceding power to Archduke Maximilian I, who now ruled over both the Duchy of Styria and the Duchy of Austria. With Sigismund's death though, the Tirolean Line of the Habsburg dynasty went extinct, completely securing Maximilian's rule over Tirol and firmly uniting the Habsburg lands in Austria.\n\nAs a result of the death of the late Duke Sigismund, the County of Tirol and the Duchy of Further Austria will now be forever attached to $COUNTRY$."

Although Albrecht II was also elected King of Germany and therefore was a strong candidate for Holy Roman Emperor, his aspirations were cut short when he died shortly after a battle with the Ottoman Turks in 1439.\n\nHowever, Albrecht II did leave behind a son, who was only born shortly after his death, Ladislaus the Posthumous, known in Latin as Ladislaus Postumus. To Ladislaus, Albrecht II bequeathed all his lands and titles, including the kingship of Bohemia, despite having never actually taken full control of that country. Now that Ladislaus Postumus is dead, his claim to the throne of Hungary has passed on to yet another line of Habsburgs.\n\nConsquently, we are now faced with a choice. Either we can respect the claims of the Habsburg rulers, and join our lands ot theirs in personal union, or we can continue an independent path under our current monarch. What shall we do?"

 ipeHAB.46.d: "Despite the fact that Ladislaus Postumus von Habsburg had right to the kingship of Bohemia through his father, Albrecht II, the country of Bohemia never actually came under his control once he came of age. Instead, while Ladislaus Postumus was indeed crowned King of Bohemia, Jirí z Podebrady, leader of the moderate Hussite lords, served as Governor of Bohemia and was its true sovereign until shortly after Ladislaus' death in 1457, at which point Jirí took the throne of Bohemia himself.\n\nNow, Ladislaus has come of age to rule in the Kingdom of Hungary. Although we do not necessarily have to allow Ladislaus to rule in Bohemia if we respect his claim to our throne, recognizing him as King of Bohemia could pose a long-term risk to our independence. However, refusing to recognize Ladislaus' claim would continue the technical state of interregnum in our country, and incense lords sympathetic to the Habsburgs. What shall we do?"

However, the takeover of Bohemia by the Hussites was not well received by the country's Catholic neighbors, who, under the leadership of King Mátyás Corvinus of Hungary, conspired to bring about the Hussites' downfall. Consequently, when Jirí z Podebrad died, the desperate Bohemian nobles sought an ally to protect themselves from Hungarian aggression.\n\nIt has since become known to us that one of the relatives of the Polish monarch, Wladyslaw Jagiellon, is eager to become a sovereign ruler in his own right, and will even take up the mantle of leadership for our war-torn kingdom. Allowing him to take our throne could greatly improve our relationships with Poland, a kingdom which could serve as a powerful ally in protecting us from the wrath of Hungary. With the enemies of Bohemia looming and ascendant, it will be a daunting task for Wladyslaw to lead the nation through the coming years. Should we entrust our fate to this aspiring noble?"

After a brief campaign against Mátyás' son János, who also claimed the Hungarian throne, Wladyslaw became the King of Hungary, and fended off similar claims to the throne from his own brother, Jan I Olbracht, and Maximilian I, the Archduke of Austria.

 ipeHAB.65.t: "The Inheritance of $COUNTRY$"
 ipeHAB.65.d: "For many years, $COUNTRY$ has enjoyed the exclusive privilege of the electoral dignity in the Holy Roman Empire, being vested with the power and right to vote for the next Holy Roman Emperor who would defend the lands of the Empire from foreign interference and coercion. However, in more recent history, $COUNTRY$ has come into personal union with $OVERLORD$, another influential state of the Holy Roman Empire, which lacks the electoral dignity. Now, the monarch of $OVERLORD$ has chosen to merge the inheritance of the electoral dignity with that of $OVERLORD$'s other titles, incorporating $COUNTRY$ directly into the realm of $OVERLORD$, with the monarch of $OVERLORD$ assuming $COUNTRY$'s rights within the Empire. As a result, by right of rulership over $COUNTRY$, the monarchs of $OVERLORD$ can now vote for the next Holy Roman Emperor."
