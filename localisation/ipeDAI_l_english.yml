 ipeDAI.1.t: "Nam Tiên"
 ipeDAI.1.d: "From the 11th to mid-18th century, the Vietnamese people gradually migrated south in a historical phenomenon that eventually became known as \"Nam Tiên,\" or the \"March to the South.\" Warring first against the Chams and then the Khmers, the Vietnamese tripled the size of their country, settling Champa and the Mekong Delta with thousands of Vietnamese and Chinese settlers, establishing new and prosperous communities, but also displacing and forcibly assimilating the natives of the region.\n\nEventually, the Cham culture and state were practically extinguished, while the Khmers were driven from the land they had long called Kampuchea Krom. Although these events marked the growth and apogee of Vietnamese imperial power, they also amounted to what would now be known as a genocide."
 ipeDAI.1.a: "But the march south goes on."
 ipeDAI.1.b: "Put an end to the settlement of the south."
 ipeDAI.1.b.tooltip: "It will be possible to resume the settlement of Champa and the Mekong Delta by decision."
 ipeDAI.2.t: "Dynastic Crisis in Vietnam"
 ipeDAI.2.d: "The rulers of Vietnam have long seen themselves as our equals, or at the very least, as our counterparts, long titling themselves Emperors who only rule by right of the Mandate of Heaven. Year after year, the Vietnamese send ample tributes to the court of our dynasty, so as to assure themselves of securing a privileged place within the Chinese tributary system, nearing themselves to the center of our universe.\n\nAlthough the Vietnamese are perhaps little better than the other barbarians we are forced to acknowledge in our diplomacy, it is nonetheless somewhat admirable how steadfastly they have mirrored and followed our own stipulations and traditions, despite not quite being one of us. Nonetheless, a dynastic crisis has now begun in Vietnam, with multiple individuals now laying claim to that country’s Mandate of Heaven.\n\nIn order to protect the interests of our dynasty in Vietnam and secure the annual tribute from that country, we should consider picking a side in that dynastic conflict. Of course, we would only anger those we refuse to back, but hardly any monarch of repute could suffer defeat after being backed by a ruler as formidable as the Emperor of China."
 ipeDAI.2.a: "Support the claimants in Tonkin."
 ipeDAI.2.b: "Support the claimants in Annam."
 ipeDAI.2.c: "Support the claimants in Dai Viêt."
 ipeDAI.2.e: "Keep out of this petty conflict."
 ipeDAI.3.t: "The Emperor of China Supports Our Dynasty!"
 ipeDAI.3.d: "The rulers of Vietnam have long seen themselves as equals to the Emperors of China, affirming their status by sending ample tributes to the Chinese dynasty year after year. Although the Chinese have often regarded us haughtily, they have also treated us with some degree of respect, considering the Vietnamese to be in a privileged position within the Chinese tributary system.\n\nAs such, the Emperor of China has come to take great interest in the dynastic conflict that has beset Vietnam, judging intensely the merits and flaws of the dynastic claimants fighting for control of the country. Ultimately, the Emperor has come to the conclusion that no dynasty other than ours, the $DYNASTY$ dynasty, is the rightful claimant to Vietnam’s Mandate of Heaven.\n\nConsequently, we have now received military support from $FROMCOUNTRY$, and $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has only become more renowned now that he has received the direct backing of the Emperor of China. With us having received Chinese support, our other rivals for dynastic control will be hard-pressed to defeat us."
 ipeDAI.3.a: "The Emperor of China has not made an incorrect judgment."

 ipeDAI.4.t: "The Emperor of China Opposes Our Dynasty!"
 ipeDAI.4.d: "The rulers of Vietnam have long seen themselves as equals to the Emperors of China, affirming their status by sending ample tributes to the Chinese dynasty year after year. Although the Chinese have often regarded us haughtily, they have also treated us with some degree of respect, considering the Vietnamese to be in a privileged position within the Chinese tributary system.\n\nAs such, the Emperor of China has come to take great interest in the dynastic conflict that has beset Vietnam, judging intensely the merits and flaws of the dynastic claimants fighting for control of the country. However, the Emperor has come to the conclusion that our dynasty, the $DYNASTY$ dynasty, is totally unworthy as a claimant to Vietnam’s Mandate of Heaven. Instead, the Emperor of China has opted to back our opponents, sending them military support and working to legitimize their rule.\n\nUnder these circumstances, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ will only be more hard-pressed to enforce his claim for dynastic control of Vietnam. We should not forget the great betrayal that the Chinese have committed upon us and our people, and be ready to return them this malevolent favor one day."
 ipeDAI.4.a: "One day we will also oppose them."

 the_empress_dowager: "The Empress Dowager"
 desc_the_empress_dowager: "Dai Viêt is currently ruled by the Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh, who is serving as regent for her son Lê Bang Co. The nobles deeply despise Nguyên Thi Anh's cruelty and pettiness, and may one day move decisively to depose her."
 ipeDAI.5.t: "The Empress Dowager"
 ipeDAI.5.d: "The previous emperor of Dai Viêt, Lê Thái Tông, died in 1442. While he left an heir in the young prince Lê Bang Co, he is only three years old now, and thus is far too young to rule. As a result, young Empress Nguyên Thi Anh has taken up the role of Lê Bang Co's regent, governing in the stead of her son. However, the nobles of the realm remain deeply suspicious of the Empress Dowager’s intentions, and may one day even conspire to bring about the end of her rule. The times are unstable and troubling for Dai Viêt."
 ipeDAI.5.a: "We must remain steadfast."
 ipeDAI.5.a.tooltip: "If the young prince Lê Bang Co is disinherited or dies early, extreme turmoil will erupt in the lands of Dai Viêt."
 ipeDAI.6.t: "The Death of Lê Bang Co"
 ipeDAI.6.d: "Emperor Lê Bang Co has died. While Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh has ruled somewhat provocatively in his stead, she cannot continue to rule without a son to claim as Emperor. Fortunately for Dai Viêt, Lê Tu Thành, yet another fitting prince of the Lê dynasty, has emerged to take the throne. A highly educated and gifted young man, Lê Tu Thành has deep and intense ambitions to restructure the Vietnamese government by transforming it along Confucian ideals, aiming to reform the country into the most powerful of the Southeast Asian nations. Dai Viêt would benefit greatly from his austerity and wisdom."
 ipeDAI.6.a: "We welcome Lê Tu Thành!"
 ipeDAI.6.b: "§RThis is the end of the Lê!§!"
 ipeDAI.7.t: "The Plot Against the Empress Dowager"
 ipeDAI.7.d: "For many years now, the nobility has chafed under the grating and cruel rule of the Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh, who has ruled over $COUNTRY$ with an iron grip, only holding power thanks to the youth and incapability of her royal son, Emperor Lê Bang Co.\n\nTiring of her arbitrary character and her petulance, the nobles have finally chosen to act by backing the claim of Lê Bang Co’s brother, Prince Lê Nghi Dân, to the Vietnamese throne. Thus came an episode of bloodshed.\n\nUnder the screen of night, Lê Nghi Dân staged a vicious and dramatic coup, with his forces storming the palace grounds, swiftly capturing the Empress Dowager and her son. The Empress Dowager, quickly realizing the futility of her position, ordered a loyal servant to kill her shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, her son was brutally murdered by Lê Nghi Dân's troops, who have since then crowned Lê Nghi Dân as the newest Emperor of $COUNTRY$."
 ipeDAI.7.a: "But do we gain in trading one unjust ruler for yet another?"
 ipeDAI.8.t: "The Downfall of Lê Nghi Dân"
 ipeDAI.8.d: "For but a brief time now, Lê Nghi Dân has ruled as the $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$, following his murder of his brother and his overthrow of the Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh. However, the people of the country have become deeply unsettled and even angry at this sudden turn of events, refusing to tolerate Lê Nghi Dân’s crime of outright fratricide. Likewise, the nobles have become alarmed at Lê Nghi Dân’s continued cruelty, which has mirrored and perhaps even become more severe than that of the late Empress Dowager.\n\nConsequently, the nobles are now backing yet another noble of the Lê dynasty, Lê Tu Thành, a educated and gifted man of Confucian ideals, who fervently ambitions to return $COUNTRY$ to glory. With the country in such severe and endless turmoil, we may have no choice but to turn our eyes to this young and aspiring prince."
 ipeDAI.8.a: "The blood of tainted monarchs must be spilt!"
 ipeDAI.8.b: "Lê Tu Thành will perish!"
 ipeDAI.9.d: "Emperor Lê Bang Co has died. While Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh has ruled somewhat provocatively in his stead, she cannot continue to rule without a son to claim as Emperor. Now, the nobles support Lê Nghi Dân, a brother of Lê Bang Co, as Bang Co’s successor. However, Lê Nghi Dân already shows all the signs of being an extremely weak and incapable ruler, and could potentially bring great ruin to $COUNTRY$. Under these circumstances, the Empress Dowager knows full well that it is in the best interest of both herself and the country that she retain power, or else risk the onslaught of Lê Nghi Dân’s anarchy."
 ipeDAI.9.a: "Even the most foolish of rulers may be legitimate."
 ipeDAI.9.b: "§RThis is the end of the Lê!§!"
 ipeDAI.10.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ Lê Nghi Dân has proven to be a more cruel and rapacious monarch than the nobles who supported him could have ever imagined. In but a brief period of time, Lê Nghi Dân has executed countless political opponents and suspected enemies, leaving behind a trail of endless bloodshed in but the earliest days of his regime.\n\nTiring and fearful of Lê Nghi Dân’s brazen bloodthirst, the nobles have already sought out another royal candidate for the throne of $COUNTRY$, seeking out the prince Lê Tu Thành, Lê Nghi Dân’s last surviving brother. An educated and gifted man of Confucian ideals, Lê Tu Thành may prove to be exactly the leader the country needs."
 ipeDAI.11.t: "Lê Bang Co Comes of Age"
 ipeDAI.11.d: "For many years now, $COUNTRY$ has been governed by the Empress Dowager Nguyên Thi Anh, who has long served in the stead of her infant son. However, now that Lê Bang Co has come of age, the nobles insist that there is little reason for the Empress Dowager to retain power, insisting that she step down so that the full succession of the Lê dynasty can finally be secured.\n\nWhile it would greatly please the nobility to secure the abdication of the Empress Dowager, Lê Bang Co would not be very capable as a ruler, adult or not. Regardless of the qualms and complaints of the nobility, it may be better for the Empress Dowager to continue her hold on power, even if only for the time being."
 ipeDAI.11.a: "It is time to step down."
 ipeDAI.11.b: "The nobility's whims are to be defied."
