 ipeAJU.1.t:0 "Integrating the Currency of Mogadishu"
 ipeAJU.1.d:0 "Following the absorption of the lands of the state of Mogadishu into the Ajuuraan Sultanate, we have found several ways in which their proficiency in trade and administration can aid us. However, if we are to benefit from the strategic development of Mogadishu, we cannot break from the city's economic system. It would be prudent therefore that we adopt Mogadishu's currency as a part of our own empire's system of exchange."
 ipeAJU.1.a:0 "Integrate their currency into our own."
 ipeAJU.1.b:0 "One Sultanate, one currency."

 ipeAJU.2.t:0 "Toob Menadir"
 ipeAJU.2.d:0 "At the height of the Ajuuraan Sultanate, Mogadishu was home to a thriving weaving industry. The production houses, known collectively as \"toob menadir,\" produced woolen cloth specifically for the markets in Egypt and Syria. The cloth traveled with merchants up along the Gulf of Aden, and was dispersed throughout the region on caravans. The cloth was highly priced, and the weaving industry brought much wealth and trade through Mogadishu."

 ipeAJU.4.t:0 "The Army of Ajuuraan"
 ipeAJU.4.d:0 "For its defense, our empire has traditionally depended on a standing army of mamluks, a foreign slave caste. As they have no connection to any of the tribes of our lands, they are far more effective at keeping the peace within our borders. However, many believe that they are far less effective at protecting our borders than a force of natural-born citizens would be. As a result, we are faced with the question of whether or not to continue our reliance upon the mamluks, or begin the raising of citizen armies."
 ipeAJU.4.a:0 "We must conscript local soldiers."
 ipeAJU.4.b:0 "Mercenaries are the best soldiers we can get."

 ipeAJU.5.t:0 "Islamic Immigration"
 ipeAJU.5.d:0 "Due to instability in other parts of the world, immigrants flock to our empire. Whether they are fleeing from conflict with Christian powers or warfare on the Arabian Peninsula, these denizens of the Muslim world simply all seek a better life, and as such deserve to be welcomed within our lands as fellow kinsmen. Many of these are people well-learned in theology, science, and the art of war, which could come to benefit our country greatly."
 ipeAJU.5.a:0 "Hire them as advisors to aid our rule."
 ipeAJU.5.b:0 "They should serve in our armies."
 ipeAJU.5.c:0 "Make a plan to settle them in our capital."
