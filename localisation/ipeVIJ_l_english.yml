 ipeVIJ.1.t: "The Nayaks of Gingee"
 ipeVIJ.1.d: "Long ago, the Vijayanagar Empire took control over the region of Gingee, subjugating the local chieftains of the area. However, it has been troublesome to govern Gingee since then, as controlling the unruly Tamil population has placed some burden on the administration of Vijayanagar.\n\nOne of our generals, Muthial Tubaki, now proposes that we allow him to rule over the Gingee region, both as reward for his services to our country and in order to provide a better local administration for the area. Indeed, we could benefit from having a new subject in this province to serve our needs."
 ipeVIJ.1.a: "They will make loyal subjects."
 ipeVIJ.1.b: "Gingee will remain under our control."
 ipeVIJ.2.t: "The Nayaks of Tanjore"
 ipeVIJ.2.d: "Until the 14th century, Tanjore was ruled by the Chola Empire, thereafter becoming a possession of Vijayanagar. One of our generals, Sevappa, showed excellent conduct in our recent military campaigns against our enemies, and $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ now considers it potentially fit to reward him for his services.\n\nWe could grant Sevappa control of the city of Tanjore and its surroundings, allowing him to rule as its nayak and our loyal feudal subject. Not rewarding Sevappa in accord with the principles of the nayankara system alternatively would cause great unrest among our existing vassals."
 ipeVIJ.2.b: "Tanjore will remain under our control."
 ipeVIJ.3.t: "The Nayaks of Keladi"
 ipeVIJ.3.d: "Local chieftains have long governed the areas in the vicinity of the city of Keladi. A land of rich farmers situated along busy trade routes, Keladi has been a useful province to the Vijayanagar Empire.\n\nHowever, one of the local chieftains, Chaudappa, would now like to become a feudatory of Vijayanagar in the Western Ghats, and found a local dynasty that would forever serve the interests of our dynasty. Indeed, we could benefit from having another loyal nayak subject to serve us."
 ipeVIJ.3.b: "Keladi will remain under our control."
